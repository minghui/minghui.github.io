I would recommend staying in and around the following areas -- Marina-Raffles or Orchard .
We stay at the ENTITY_City_Bayview , breakfast included , central location , close to trains , buses , and eating places , also internet cafe .
The hotel I stayed before is called Crown Prince Hotel , right at downtown ENTITY_Singapore .
Tough criteria but it can be met if you dun mind living in the red light district of ENTITY_Singapore .
For cheaper hotel with good quality , look for hotels along bencoolen road , such as strand hotel , bencoolen hotel , or city ENTITY_bayview . 
The ENTITY_Singapore_International was very good -LRB- in the 60 's -RRB- The ENTITY_Adelphi is very central , ENTITY_The_Raffles was good , too .
For upscale , go to ENTITY_Orchard Road/Marina Centre Area for the top class hotels , including the famous ENTITY_Raffles_Hotel_Singapore at Bras Basah Road .
Most of the hotels are from S$ 100 onwards for three stars and above .
Can also consider ENTITY_Holiday_Inn at ENTITY_Outram area .
there are reasonable budget hotels near town -LRB- check hotel 81 , hotel 1929 , peacock hotel , sloane court , or balmoral hotel which is slightly more expensive -RRB- . 
You can consider ENTITY_Summer_Tavern , it has hostel as well hotel .
If you 're on a budget , you may want to avoid Hotels in the heart of the ENTITY_Orchard area .
Hotels with EVEN street number in ENTITY_Geylang_Singapore are in the red light district .
You can go to ENTITY_Chijmes , it is just opposite the hotel and there are nice restaurants & Bars there and also very good atmosphere .
hi , i guess for that rate , maybe you can try ENTITY_YMCA_International_House that can be found on 88db , it is located right in the heart of Singaporeâ€™s shopping , tourist and entertainment centre , or you can also try ENTITY_Orchard_Road_Boutique_Suites , and hotels near the city can be quite costly
