Vivocity is the latest biggest shopping mall in ENTITY_Singapore , you should shop there and look around !
Must see tourist attractions : The night safari - first night zoo in the world -LRB- opens at 7pm -RRB- ENTITY_Jurong_Birg_Park - lots of birds and also features the world highest man made waterfall .
The more popular places would be : ENTITY_Orchard_Towers also know as the five floors of whores - there are many night clubs there where ladies from various parts of asia come to look for men for the same kinda fun ... except they expect to be paid .
The red light district is the entire area which starts from about ENTITY_Lorong 8 & ends at about ENTITY_Lorong 24 .
If the function room of SIS is too big , I suggest try at ENTITY_Community_Club .
However , the popular spots would be : 1 -RRB- ENTITY_Clark_Quay - great lighting , funky places to eat , drink and move to the music .
There are dozen of clubs & bars around the area you are putting up.
There is also a more expensive place in the Hyatt Hotel called Mezza-nine with choices from fresh sushi to grilled angus beef , which is great .
Also try all the pubs in Boat Quay and along ENTITY_River_Valley_Road and ENTITY_Mohammed_Sultan_Road .
beside esplanade , there 's this awesome eating place called makansutra .
Go for afternoon tea buffet at ENTITY_Equinox in Swissotel -LRB- on the 70th floor , best view anywhere and great food too -RRB- .
ENTITY_St_'s_Andrew_Cathedral is a distinctive and elegant institution & designed by Colonel ENTITY_Ronald_MacPherson in 1856 , it replaced the original church which was destroyed by two lightning strikes in 1852 .
Boat Quay / ENTITY_Clarke_Quay is good for a light night out , very westernised but good mix of travllers and locals . 
The ENTITY_Geylang area , also spelt Gaylang or Geylan ... is a good place for nightlife in ENTITY_Singapore . 
The last I 've tried ENTITY_Singapore Sling was a few years back and it costs S$ 16 , or S$ 25 with a souvenir glass .
