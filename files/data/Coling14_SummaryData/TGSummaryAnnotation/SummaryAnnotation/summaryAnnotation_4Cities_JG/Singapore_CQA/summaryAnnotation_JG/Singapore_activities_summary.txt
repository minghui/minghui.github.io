First quarter of 2008 , I would advise you not to visit during Chinese New Year as most shops would be closed , the streets would be quiet and it would be very boring unless you are visiting local relatives like the rest of us .
The Night safari is right next to the zoo , both of which are located at mandai road .
I usually bring my kids to the beach , they love it there , I can just dump their sand castle tools and I 'm free to just enjoy the afternoon talking to my hubby .
I live in ENTITY_Singapore as far as I know the best place you can enjoy here is in ENTITY_Sentosa .
On the way back stop at ENTITY_Sempang_Bedok at the ` Ancient Chinese Cusine ' Restaurant for the best and most unique Chinese food you will find .
Once you finish at ENTITY_Suntec , go to Marina shopping center then finally to ENTITY_Esplande , we locals call it the durian due to its shape .
ENTITY_Orchard road has many shopping centres , Vivocity is one big one and less crowded cos of the size , and you can hop on the train to ENTITY_Sentosa_Island for a day trip where there 's beaches , can cycle and places of interests .
You can go to the National Museum , the ENTITY_Peranakan_Museum or the Art Museum .
I had stay in a few different hotel in ENTITY_Singapore , they had no problem for me to extension -LRB- some even allow me to check out at 3:30 pm -RRB- .
In ENTITY_Singapore , if you 're into local delights and nothing touristy , head down to the neighbourhood areas ... a recommendation would be ENTITY_Ang_Mo_Kio -LRB- close to town -RRB- .
Yes , migration sounds fun and great for a 18 years old girls as girls are free to go .
It will take 30 minutes at least to go from ENTITY_Jurong_Bird_Park to Night Safari if not longer depending on the traffic at the time and how you are getting there .
If you 're into the war stuff , then ENTITY_Changi museum , ENTITY_Fort_Canning_Battle_Box and ENTITY_Fort_Siloso on Sentosa are worth a look around .
The ENTITY_Stamford is a good hotel and right in the middle of town so easy access to everything .
Go for afternoon tea buffet at ENTITY_Equinox in Swissotel -LRB- on the 70th floor , best view anywhere and great food too -RRB- .
