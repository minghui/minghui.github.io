I would try for the ENTITY_Marriott or one of the more known hotel chains and see if you can find a good deal .
Just south of ENTITY_Anaheim on ENTITY_Harbor_Boulevard is a cluster of new hotels that are close to ENTITY_Disneyland , but a world away as far as prices go .
I recommend the Farmer 's Daughter Hotel near Third and ENTITY_Fairfax , a pretty safe area right in the middle of the city .
If you have a problem with a hotel , it is much easier to be resolved than if you are renting home .
In ENTITY_Hollywood , I recommend the Orchid Suites , Hollywood Celebrity Hotel , or ENTITY_Hollywood_Heights -LRB- formerly Holiday Inn Walk of Fame -RRB- , all near ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland .
You can , however , probably find a hotel with a kitchenette so you could have a fridge and not do all of you meals at restaurants .
Hotels on the east or west side of the park are closer to the entrance of the park , still too far for a kid .
Not necessarily to book a hotel or anything but it will give you a good idea of some of the hotels in the area and what they have .
there are quite a few sites that you can search that will likely show you great hotels at the best prices available .
The Hotel ENTITY_Catherine is the closest to the dock , but it is a real dump .
ALL ENTITY_Disneyland hotels are booked for next week , -LRB- Maybe you can find one on ENTITY_Expedia -RRB- but that is what the site says .
Before you book , call the hotel and make sure the shuttle stops there .
You can stay at one of the Disney hotels -LRB- Grand Californian or Disneyland Hotel -RRB- , a huge ENTITY_Hilton or ENTITY_Marriott , or any of dozens of other choices .
The hotels in ENTITY_Irvine actually go down quite a bit in price on the weekends because they are mostly for business travelers .
Also , it is sometimes cheaper to rent a hotel for a week than an apartment .
