Go on `` Map Quest '' on line and type in your destination based on the location you are starting from .
Know this about ENTITY_LA , the reason we have horrible traffic is because the area is so vast , a car is often the only option .
Right Peddlepup that is why we need an ENTITY_Anaheim Flyaway bus ... to avoid bus to Union Station , ENTITY_Metrolink to ENTITY_Anaheim , then taxi to hotel or some ridiculous thing .
Plus , if you decide to make a day of it coming from ENTITY_LA consider using ENTITY_Amtrak from ENTITY_LA_Union_Station to ENTITY_Downtown_SD .
The traffic is tough around ENTITY_LAX , there is really nothing to do in that area other than other hotels , not an area to walk around at all .
Try just using the ENTITY_Metro transit system , they offer an all day pass for only $ 5 Which is valid for use on all regular bus & subway lines .
A cab from H&H to downtown would be expensive and there is always traffic on the 101 even at that time of night .
so its gon na take awhile in ENTITY_l.a. traffic ... as far as getting there you can take a cab or a shuttle service there are several that work out of the airport
Our mass transit system here is not very good and you will literally spend hours and have to change buses/trains many times to do what you want .
Do understand that except for a few places downtown , in ENTITY_LA , taxis are not allowed to accept riders who try to flag them .
It does n't work for everyone , but I encourage everyone to at least try getting around without their car for just a day , or even just a weekend or an afternoon .
Figure out which places you should see on the same day , and then plan the routes on ENTITY_Google_Maps -LRB- the little bus icon is for public transportation routes -RRB- , or at www.metro.net
If you are planning to move here and rely on public transportation , you should plan accordingly .
There are public transportation however if you 're not familiar with the place then you might get lost .
if you 're going to spend a few weeks in ENTITY_LA the best way to travel around ENTITY_LA usin public transportation is to buy an ENTITY_LA_Metro tap-card which costs about $ 60-70 and valid thru month
