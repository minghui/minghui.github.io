Melrose Avenue or the Beverly Center in ENTITY_Bev_Hills , but I would go to Melrose ... you ca n't get any better than that , they 'll love it
if you where to go to hollywood prices and be a bit hefty but well worth it since they have the most interesting yet bizarre souvenirs .
a wine shop i 'd definitely reccommend for you to check out and dine in is the ENTITY_San_Antonio_Winery .
if you want to buy electronics , go to Electronic Frys .
Generally , the more nice parts of LA like ENTITY_Hollywood , Melrose street and west hollywood are more expensive .
The stores range from the very inexpensive up to world-class expensive , it depends on where you decide to shop .
The ENTITY_Beverly_Center is a great place to shop , as is Rodeo Drive , if you have money .
On the far east of ENTITY_LA , out by ENTITY_Ontario_Airport , is ENTITY_Ontario_Mills , a huge complex , and close to that is ENTITY_Victoria_Gardens , another huge outdoor mall .
Contrary to what you believe , they shop at regular department stores like ENTITY_JC_Penney , ENTITY_Sears , ENTITY_Macy_'s , etc. .
The cheap knock off stuff is sold in an area called ENTITY_Santee_Alley .
For cheap , you can shop at places like ENTITY_Ross or Target ... or head for the Fashion District south of the Civic Center .
We usually just go to Downtown , where we buy whatever stuff we need .
The Block at ENTITY_Orange is an open air mall with restaurants and specialty stores , but no anchor stores .
I prefer the outdoor malls so I 'd recommend The Grove and Americana at Brand in ENTITY_Glendale .
the most popular is the beverly center of course , they recently remodeled it too , it looks nice and theres a lot of stores in there .
