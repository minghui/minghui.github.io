If you 're into nightlife have dinner at Blue Velvet for a great view of the city then afterward go to the Roof Bar at the ENTITY_Standard_Hotel , Seven Grand and to the ENTITY_Edison for drinks . 
If you want to slum it with the hipsters drink at the ENTITY_Golden_Gopher , ENTITY_Broadway_Bar and ENTITY_Redwood_Bar_&_Grill . 
Union Station is also next to Olvera Street and is worth looking at for the architecture and to hop on the ENTITY_Metro_Rail .
If you have lunch at the Kyoto Grand Hotel & Gardens you can view their half acre Japanese Garden that is on the 3rd floor .
You can work out at any of a number of places , including the storied ENTITY_LA_Athletic_Club or the Downtown Y .
For Christmas time visits , they have the ranch all decorated , ENTITY_Santa_Claus is there , reindeer for kids to see and pet , cookie decorating , carolers walking around on main street singing . 
The fireworks are always awesome , and sometimes you will get lucky and catch carolers strolling up and down Main Street .
Eat at the ENTITY_Blue_Bayou -LRB- the indoor restaurant where you sit and watch the boats from ENTITY_Pirates of the ENTITY_Carribean go by .
You can do things such as hang out at the beach , shop , lots of restaurants , kayak , snorkel , glass bottom boat ride , miniature golf , hiking , take a tram tour of the island , rent a golf cart , see a movie , go to the botanical gardens , etc. .
Avalon is a pretty small place although it is hilly and carrying your luggage would be a pain , the golf cart rental is a good idea .
Everyone loves ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Universal and where the movie making all happens .
The last time i had been to LA i had booked a limo from ENTITY_Ultimate_Limousines and they took me to various places in LA.
I would say check ENTITY_Venice_Beach one of the nicer beaches in the area ... and Lots to see -LRB- people watching -RRB- but if shoppings you thing Melrose Ave would be a cool place to go .
You can see everything possible , including a trip to the interior to see the buffalo , have a lovely dinner , and take the hour ferry trip back to the mainland .
I recommend going to the Music Center or Staples center Here is something I have n't seen on this forum to visit if you are into cars , This is a must see ENTITY_Peterson_Automotive_Museum_6060_Wilshire_Blvd , ENTITY_Los_Angeles , CA Its not downtown -LRB- closer to west ENTITY_Los_Angeles -RRB- but it 's well worth the time
