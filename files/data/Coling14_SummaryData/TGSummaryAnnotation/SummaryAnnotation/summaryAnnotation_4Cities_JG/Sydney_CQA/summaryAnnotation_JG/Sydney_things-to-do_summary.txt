A good idea for one day could include the morning harbour bridge climb, followed with a stroll around the rocks & along Macquarie St towards Hyde Park and St Mary's Cathedral, and past the art gallery, the botanical gardens & the opera house.
Then maybe catch the ferry from Circular Quay to Manly & have some lunch at the Bavarian restaurant on the wharf.
Then wander down thru the Corso to get to the main beach.
You can also take a ferry to Manly or ENTITY_Taronga Zoo .
Get the bus back down again, and then catch the ferry back to the city.
Sydney Aquarium will be a great place to see most of the oceans fish and sharks at a safe spot.
there is plenty around there museums the maritime one is good and you could make your way to Sydney tower and do the sky walk 230metres above on a glass floor.
A trip on the river cat up to Parramatta is good also over to Manly on the ferry .
If you can spare an extra day then a day trip to the Blue Mountains is lovely.
There is also a nearby historic area called ` The Rocks ' which you would find interesting too . 
Or take a taxi to ENTITY_Maroubra_Beach if the weather 's nice .
There is not a great deal within walking distance but you could try ENTITY_Barton_Park .
Also you can get the train to Central station and visit ENTITY_China town and easy short walk from Central .
Jump on a train out to ENTITY_Katoomba for a day trip to the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains , or you can book a tour leaving the city itself .
Board the ENTITY_Sydney Showboat for a unique dinner cruise experience .
