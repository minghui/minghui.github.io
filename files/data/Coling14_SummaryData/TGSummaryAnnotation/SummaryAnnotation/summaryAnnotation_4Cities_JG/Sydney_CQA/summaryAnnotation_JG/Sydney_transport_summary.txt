If you are travelling alone , I recommend you use the train but if there are more than 2 people it will be cheaper to use a taxi or hotel shuttle service .
You do n't need to tip taxi drivers in ENTITY_Australia and they do n't expect it .
It would be cheaper for you to catch a CityRail train from the airport to the Museum station and walk from there
If you rent a car do n't forget you 'll be driving on the `` wrong '' side of the road and in ENTITY_Sydney proper this is extremely hazardous .
You can see a LOT of ENTITY_Sydney in five days using public transport , which is extremely affordable .
You can buy a day ticket which gives you unlimited access to all trains , government buses and most ferries .
There is a red Explorer bus that travels a circuit round most of the places of note near the city .
The trains are becoming more and more pleasing to use now .
The bus to the station in the mornings is n't too bad but in the afternoons , you can never rely on it .
As for the trains , they 're usually on time or within a couple of minutes , so that does n't worry me too much , it 's just how crowded they are .
the only place i can think of where a tourist might consider renting a car is a day to go to the blue mountains
Parking is a headache in ENTITY_Sydney , expensive and hard to find , and the traffic is crazy .
You 'll get much quicker around by trains and buses than by car .
If you are in ENTITY_Sydney Center , it is better to have a season ticket which is cheap , for transport .
There is also a $ 2 airport fee that is added to all cab tariffs departing from the airport .
