My partner and I love outdoor rock climbing - free where you can find it !
Take a harbor to the ENTITY_Sydney Zoo you 'll see all the country 's animals .
The first day you will find plenty to see by just walking around but the Powerhouse museum is a must on the first day .
The mountain tour is the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains - which will be cold , but not too bad .
take a sight seeinng ferry from circular quay , or go to the zoo , fun fun fun .
More in the centre of the city -LRB- Town Hall station -RRB- you can go up ENTITY_Sydney Tower for a birds eye view .
Take a harbor cruise to the Sydney Toranga Zoo you'll see all the country's animals.
Tour "The Rocks", if you are at the harbor it's too the left, this is the oldest part of Sydney.
Also , after enjoying the great Australian sunlight , stand under the ENTITY_Opera_House for a great photo in the shade !
There 's the area around the opera house , I think it 's called circular quay , that takes you up to the rocks , it 's nice there two .
sightseeing throughout ENTITY_sydney cood be fun especially if they have never been here before .
Shopping is everywhere, Pitt St mall, Victorias basement and DFO (discount factory outlet) at Homebush.
Go up the blue mountains for a day and look at the pretty nature.
Then i would wander south along ENTITY_George_Street towards ENTITY_Chinatown - ENTITY_George_St is a nice lively street , there are some really nice restaurants in Spanish quarters along that street .
CentrePoint tower might appeal to both of you, it's the tallest tower in Australia so that's kind of cool.
