As an aside , the most disappointing meal I have ever had in ENTITY_Sydney was at one of the places at The Rocks that has an international reputation .
King St ENTITY_Newtown and ENTITY_Glebe are great places to find a huge range of inexpensive restaurants that serve good food .
One of my fav places (not very suitable for an anniversary but a good place to try during your 2 week stay) is Pancakes on The Rocks.
Cosy atmosphere, good menu and just an all round top pub.
for restaurants , there 's amazing food on the ENTITY_sydney harbor -LRB- varying prices
You could get a feast of asian/thai/african / japanese along the newtown strip and walk out not having spent over 80-100 for a two person banquet including drinks 
Out of ENTITY_Africa in Manly Superbowl or BBQ King in ENTITY_Chinatown -LRB- Service and decor is crap but the food is great
If you want a really good curry go to The Clove on Crown Street .
Another option is to go to ENTITY_Watson 's Bay for the famous fish and chips .
ENTITY_Tetsuya 's in ENTITY_Sydney has been voted one of the top 5 restaurents in the world .
here are also some great restaurants and bars at ENTITY_Finger_Wharf in ENTITY_Woolloomooloo .
For a drink and the best view in ENTITY_Sydney go the bar on the 35th floor of the Shangri-La Hotel in the Rocks.
Must pubs in ENTITY_Sydney have $ 5 steaks with a salad & baked potato and it 's top quality .
 Go to the two major restaurant areas close to the city - ENTITY_Darlinghurst , along ENTITY_Oxford_Street , and ENTITY_Newtown , along King Street .
