As for the ENTITY_Acer_Arena , that is in the ENTITY_Homebush Olympic Park and you can choose to live in either ENTITY_Parramatta or the ENTITY_City .
It is called ENTITY_Base_Backpackers and it is a new type of backpacker place that is luxury
The ENTITY_Westin , ENTITY_Sydney Probably most central of any hotel -LRB- used to be GPO -RRB- and has a choice of old style rooms or modern style .
I would suggest maybe trying Rydges -LRB- on Grosvener St I think
The ENTITY_Sydney_Marriot hotel is nice on circular quay -LRB- its within walking distance of the opera house , ENTITY_Harbour_Bridge and there is lots of stuff to do close to it
Sydney hotels are booked out for months before New Year, so make sure you allow for that and book in good time.
The only place i would recommend that has apartment set up for families/disabilties facilities is Hyde Park Plaza Sydney.
Any hotel/backpacker hostel or good accommadation place will hook you up for a day tour .
Quay Grand is the best for what you want .
The chances of you finding some cheap alternatives is best if you look at one of the last minute web sites where accommodation providors release their unsold rooms.
Some of the offers include a few free extras like breakfast and use of facilities, but you really need to make up your mind where in the City you want to stay.
Generally the cheapest places are in Kings Cross which isn't the nicest area but it is a short walk to the city centre.
Decent hotels, which are not too expensive and has a good location are Crest Hotel next to Kings Cross railway station, which means travelling becomes very easy and Ibis World Square, both are 3 star hotels.
You could also try some of the Accor hotels such as the Ibis or Formule 1
I stayed at the De Vere hotel a couple of months ago which is a decent budget hotel.
