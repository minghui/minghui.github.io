my friend lives in the ENTITY_Bronx and said subway really crowded before games .
I 'd suggest just leaving your car right where it is and taking a train to ENTITY_JFK and home from ENTITY_Laguardia .
i always drove to ENTITY_atlantic_city for a motel , and took the bus into nyc .
Both the subways and buses run all night long every day .
I never take taxis - they are expensive , get stuck in traffic and many of the drivers are reckless .
My advice is leave the car outside the city -LRB- i.e. the suburbs -RRB- and take the train into the city . 
There is some cheap parking on the west side on some old piers that is cheap , and some cheap places on the far east side . 
At the Times Square subway station there will be a map , look there to get to the Canal Street station .
If you do n't want to take public transit , which is very cheap , take the ENTITY_New_York_Airport_Service shuttle bus .
With a car in NYC , sometimes it 's like so hard to find a parking space but , with a car in NYC , you do n't have to wait for a train bus or especially the taxi .
ENTITY_Real_New_Yorker take public transit , which is the best and cheapest way to go .
ou can take ENTITY_New_Jersey_Transit trains from ENTITY_Denville to ENTITY_Penn_Station in ENTITY_Manhattan .
If you 're in NY and do n't know the place by heart like the people that live there , take my advice and use the subway .
If you plan to go to college here in NYC , having a car is out of the question with transportation 24/7 .
You could park on the street with you building is located , but fair warning , there are day that the street sweeper need to clean the street , so you may have to move you car from one side of the street to the other the night before .
