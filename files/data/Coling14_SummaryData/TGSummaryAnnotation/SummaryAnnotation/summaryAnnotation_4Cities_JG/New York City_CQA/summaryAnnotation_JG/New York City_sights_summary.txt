Statue of ENTITY_Liberty , Empire State Building and of course last but not the least , the very famous TWIN TOWERS of the World Trade Center
Times Square is definitely a great place to visit to get a feel of the city .
Also an art lover , you should not miss the Metropolitan Museum .
a walk through ENTITY_Chinatown if you want to practice your haggling and ENTITY_Little_Italy which borders ENTITY_Chinatown .
But you are bound to miss a lot , especially considering ENTITY_Manhattan is only one of the five boroughs , and next to smallest .
If you have children with you , consider starting at ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center
ENTITY_Museum_of_Modern_Art is just three blocks away and the Apple store - lots of cool gadgets is close by as well .
Take the train to NYC and be sure to go to the ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History - it is VERY child friendly and there is so much to see for a boy/girl and adults !!
Take her to ENTITY_FAO_Schwartz at 58 ENTITY_St_&_Fifth_Avenue .
I found the museum on ENTITY_Ellis_Island really interesting .
Go to the ENTITY_Sony building , where inside the atrium behind the store there 's sony world and it 's a free interactive exhibit tour .
The Cloisters , the Met 's strictly-medieval branch , is generally less crowded .
A Ride on the ENTITY_Staten_Island Ferry -LRB- its free and you can see the Statue of Liberty as the ferry crosses the harbor
The ENTITY_Municipal_Art_Society_You can visit some of the most famous landmarks in the city .
Second day I would go to the Village and check out ENTITY_Washington_Park where part of ENTITY_NYU is spread out over and then Central Park by 5th Avenue in the 50 's , where the tony -LRB- meaning fancy -RRB- stores are like ENTITY_Tiffanys .
