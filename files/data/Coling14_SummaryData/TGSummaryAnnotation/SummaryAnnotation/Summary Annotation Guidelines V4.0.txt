                                                      Summary Annotation Guidelines

<<INTRODUCTION>>
In this work, we aim to generate travel guides from user-generated content in Q&A communities such as
Yahoo! Answers. Observing that standard travel guides such as those from Lonely Planet may be outdated
or limited, we turn to social media to look for fresh content. In social media, many users contribute their travel
experience and recommendations. Specifically, our task is to generate summaries for different sections of 
each city in Q&A threads of social media.

<<DATASET>>
(1) Our data set contains Q&A threads related to 4 cities. The cities are as follows:  "Singapore", "Los Angeles", 
"New York City", "Sydney". We have preprocessed the data and chosen the following 8 sections: "restaurants", 
"hotels", "shopping",  "sights", "entertainment-nightlife", "activities", "transport", "things-to-do".

(2) For each section of each city, we have 30 relevant Q&A threads. The annotators should select 15 sentences from
 these 30 relevant Q&A threads to generate section focused summary.
.

<<ANOTATION GUIDELINES>>
(1) For each section of each city, the following standards should be considered when annotators select 15 sentences
 from 30 relevant Q&A threads to generate the summary:

Relevance: a good summary should contain informative textual units with relevance to the section/city.
Coverage: a good summary should cover important and representative information in the Q&A threads.
Redundancy: a good summary should not contain multiple textual units that convey the same information.
Length: the summary should contain 15 sentences and the total length should tend to be in (250, 400) 
words interval. The limit for the number of words is not compulsive.

(2) The annotators should order the selected sentences by importances and put more critical sentence ahead.

<<ANNOTATION FORMAT>>
(1) All Q&A threads to be summarized are in "travelCQA_4Cities" folder and they have been separated by cities
and sections. The summary annatations are in the other 4 folders. For example, the folder 
"summaryAnotation_4Cities_YL\Singapore_CQA\summaryAnotation_YL" is created to put all annotated summaries for Singapore
 by "YL"(Annotator ID. e.g. "DY", "LZ", "JG"). The format of the name of this folder(refereed as summary folder) is 
"summaryAnotation_4Cities_AnnotatorID\CityName_CQA\summaryAnotation_AnnotatorID". 

(2) In each summary folder, 8 section focused summary files will be created. The format of the name of this file(refereed
 as summary file) is "CityName_SectionName_summary.txt". For example, "Singapore_restaurants_summary.txt" is the 
labelled section focused summary for section "restaurants" and city "Singapore".

(3) Each summary file contains 15 sentences selected from Q&A threads according to annotation guidelines. Each line 
is a sentence.
