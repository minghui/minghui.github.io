Sydney and the mountains will be cold in June, so rug up for a trip to the Blueys and enjoy.

Some of the better attractions are The Sydney Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge, The Rocks, Darling Harbour, The IMAX Theatre, Star City, and the Sydney Aquarium. Don't forget to try the Monorail Loop and check out the Writer's Walk. Blue Mountain is surely worth a trip for the scenery and national parks. Have fun!
