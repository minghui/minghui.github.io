If you can afford to, stay in the darling harbour area. Or close to public transport. Consider an apartment instead of just a hotel room. Quest and Medina might be worth a look. Shopping is everywhere, Pitt St mall, Victorias basement and DFO (discount factory outlet) at Homebush. Clubbing is Oxford St, the clubs are open till at least 5am and there is more then enough to chose from. Things to do, well with only one weekend and your plan to shop, there wont be much time for anything else. But do try and visit the rocks, perhaps have dinner there.

Shopping in the city is good, or the Bondi Junction Westfield which is the biggest... Or if you can get transport out to Homebush, DFO is worth it. Clubs... Vivaz in the Rocks or La Cita in Darling Harbour if you're in to real latin american dancing. There are other clubs in the rocks like retro (5 levels), cargo etc. Catch a ferry to Manly. Go to the Zoo (also good by ferry). If you can afford it, do bridgeclimb. Go up the blue mountains for a day and look at the pretty nature. Some of the museums can be fun too.

There are pubs, clubs, restaurants and the city is a bus or ferry away. Surf shops and boutiques. Do you like comedy shows? every friday 8pm Theatre sports at the Clarence Hotel 450 Parramatta Rd Petersham, cheap food and entry. It's hilarious. You can catch a bus from the city, or take a cab.
