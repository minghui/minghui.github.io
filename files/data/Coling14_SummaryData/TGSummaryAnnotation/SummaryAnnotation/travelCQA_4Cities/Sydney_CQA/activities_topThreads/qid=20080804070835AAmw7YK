Looking on expedia.co.uk it is hard to know which is best . Those that are 5star with harbour views are too expensive for us . Any slightly less expensive -LRB- not `` budget '' though -RRB- but with a harbour view is what we would like . Many thanks to anybody who replies .

I 've had the chance to stay in ENTITY_Sydney to visit my cousin a couple of months ago and i stayed at this 3.5 star hotel in ENTITY_Crows_Nest . It 's called Sovereign Inn -LRB- ENTITY_Crows_Nest -RRB- . I recommend it to you because it is cheaper than other hotels in town but you 'll never feel any substandard service/accommodation . Plus , the hotel is `` said to be '' admired for the panoramic view it has -- the magnificent sydney skyline and the hanger -LRB- ENTITY_Harbour_Bridge -RRB- . So there , i hope you 'll enjoy . Good luck ! oh , here 's its website . you might want to take a look at it : http://www.sovereigninnsydney.com/

However , I have stayed at the Novotel at ENTITY_Darling_Harbour . It 's handy to everything -LRB- including the eateries in ENTITY_Cockle 's Bay -RRB- , and only a short trip -LRB- on the Monorail -RRB- to downtown ENTITY_Sydney . The prices are `` reasonable '' -LRB- for downtown ENTITY_Sydney -RRB- at around the $ 200 per night mark . And the view of the ENTITY_Sydney skyline at night is quite spectacular . The only other suggestion is the other side of ENTITY_The_Harbour . Try something around Cremorne or ENTITY_Milson 's Point . Have a lovely holiday .

I know it is beautiful on the Harbor but you would have to pay for anything on the harbor and you are looking for alot of money as it would cost at least $ 500 plus . You could always get something away from the harbor and always go to a nice place for week-ends . You can rent some really nice place in town but the ENTITY_Harbor are only for people who make alot of money worst luck as they have 3 star on the Harbor and they are worth the $ 500 a week . It is to expensive . Hope this helps . Take care .
