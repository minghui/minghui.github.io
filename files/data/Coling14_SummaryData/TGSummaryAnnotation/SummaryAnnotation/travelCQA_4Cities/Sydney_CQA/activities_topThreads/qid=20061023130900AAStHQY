I am planning on staying at the ENTITY_Summer_Manley_Youth_Hostel over the new year but my friends have booked in somewhere near the ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge and I was wondering how far the two places are apart i.e. how much a cab ride would be or if it is quick and easy to get to on public transport

If on the city side , a boat will be the quickest way of getting to them . There are high speed sea cats which will get you there in about 15 minutes . the boats take about 30 minutes . If they are on the north shore of the bridge , you can take a bus from Manly pier to wherever they live . it should take about 20 minutes or so . Not sure how much transport is there now . I was there 10 years ago and stayed in Manly . it 's gorgeous . have a great time .

The drive in a car or taxi takes anywhere from 30 mins to an hour depending on traffic and the time of the day - there 's a toll of A$ 2 on the way to the city , taxi would be around $ 25-30 . The bus goes from Manly Wharf to the city , there are several express buses all very busy , takes about 30 minutes on a good day , fare would be about A$ 3 . Check out the ENTITY_Sydney_Public_Transport site .

Manly is about a half hour ferry ride from ENTITY_Circular_Quay . Circular Quay is about a 10 - 15 min walk from the bridge on the south shore if I remember . You can catch another ferry to ENTITY_McMahon 's Point on the North Shore , which again is about a 15 min walk from the northern end of the bridge . This is going back 10 years so my times may be a few minutes either way and bus services may have got better .

It runs from Manly harbour to ENTITY_Sydney harbour without stopping elsewhere within 15 minutes . It costs more than a `` normal '' ferry which also runs from Manly to ENTITY_Sydney - but with a couple of stops along the way . Anyway , if you want to stay there for quite a while and you want to use this ferry each day or so you should think about buying a weekly or monthly ticket because this is much cheaper than buying a single ticket each time . JetCat only runs in the morning and afternoon hours on a special schedule . The normal ferry runs whole day long until night . Get yourself informations about schedules of both , JetCat and ferry at Circular Quay information centre close to wharves 4 and 5 including tickets .

Do it again after dark , the skyline is fabulous

The ferry costs $ 6 for a return and takes 30 mins , they come every 30 mins or so all day . You can get a discount on a multi-use ticket . There is a bus , it is cheaper but not as cool as the ferry . I would recomend staying at the D-lux Buget Hotel on ENTITY_Darlinghurst as that was a great hostel . I have just come back -LRB- 4 weeks ago -RRB- from down under - e-mail me if you want any advice or details ! Have a FANTASTIC trip !
