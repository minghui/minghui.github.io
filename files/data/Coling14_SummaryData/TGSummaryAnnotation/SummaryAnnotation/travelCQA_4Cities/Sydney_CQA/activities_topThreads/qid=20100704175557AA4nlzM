Since you only have three days and have kids you must go to Taronga Zoo. I was there recently to see the Baby Elephants and they are so much fun to watch. Make sure you are there when the keepers bring out the Soccer Ball for them to play with. Luk Chai just had his 1st Birthday. 1. Taronga Zoo http://www.taronga.org.au/taronga-zoo/ouâ€?2. Catch the Manly Ferry from Circular Quay, Sydney Harbour to Manly the walk down the mall to Manly Beach. http://www.manlyaustralia.com.au/ 3. Sydney Wildlife World http://sydneywildlifeworld.myfun.com.au/ 4. Sydney Jet Boat (My kids loved it and make sure you where there rain coat) http://www.sydneyjet.com.au/ 5. Skywalk Sydney Tower http://sydneytower.myfun.com.au/ 6. Ride the Mono Rail around the City. http://www.metrotransport.com.au/index.pâ€?7. Catch the ferry to luna Park. The kids will love the rides http://www.lunaparksydney.com/ There are heaps more things to do but youâ€™re not going to have the time to do them. If you go to the blue mountains that will take you a day so I donâ€™t think you will have the time to go there.
