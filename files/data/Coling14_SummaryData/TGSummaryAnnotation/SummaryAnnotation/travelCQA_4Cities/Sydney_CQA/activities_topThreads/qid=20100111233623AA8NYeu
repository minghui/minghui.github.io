They go directly to the Circular Quay , which is right between the ENTITY_Opera_House and the ENTITY_Harbor_Bridge . Note that I 'm not sure how long a train takes to get from the airport to downtown -- check schedules , and be aware that it 's quite probably a bad idea if the trip takes more than an hour each way .

Do n't know cost of ticket but it would only be about $ 20 and the trip takes about 20 minutes each way . You can walk around the harbor area to the ENTITY_Opera_House and you can see the beautiful harbor bridge . There is also a nearby historic area called ` The Rocks ' which you would find interesting too . Better than hanging around the airport for five hours .

They leave every 5-10 minutes or so and the trip is around 20 minutes . Then you 've got plenty to do . A return ticket is $ 25 . Or take a taxi to ENTITY_Maroubra_Beach if the weather 's nice . You need to be sure you can get a taxi back again though . Or taxi to the ENTITY_Eastgardens_Westfield Shopping Centre . There is nothing whatsoever to do within walking distance of the airport , it 's an industrial area .
