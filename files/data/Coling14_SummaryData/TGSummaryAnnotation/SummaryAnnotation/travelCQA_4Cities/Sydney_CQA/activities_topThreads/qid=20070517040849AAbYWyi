ENTITY_Sydney has a great deal of one of kind `` Things to Do '' . First off you have to buy the `` Passbook '' do n't recall the name but you 'll find it through any travel agency or you can purchase them at the Harbor . Plan your day -LRB- s -RRB- around the passbook schedule . Here are the things my bride and I did . Take a harbor to the ENTITY_Sydney Zoo you 'll see all the country 's animals . Tour the Opera house if there is a concert try see it . Tour `` The Rocks '' , if you are at the harbor it 's too the left , this is the oldest part of ENTITY_Sydney . There are a number of places in the Rocks to visit . Make sure , if you are up to it to do the bridge climb , this is a real treat . The locals call it the `` Coat Hanger '' , for good reason . There is a museum on one on the pillars close to the rocks that explain the bridge and harbor . There is a monorail in town you have to ride it once . Take a harbor cruise toward the entrance to ENTITY_Sydney_Harbor you will see a lot of the area . There are harbor ferries that run all over the place take one to the Aquarium you 'll be impressed with the shark tank and Maritime Museum just across the waterway . Walk up to the Observatory on observatory hill . There are two `` Ghost Tours '' if you have two nights , you must make reservations in advance take one or both . There is a lot of history in and around the Rocks . Shopping , you will not fall short of shopping . There is even an ENTITY_F.W._Woolworth 's store . You 'll find plenty of information around town on things to do . You will not be bored . The ENTITY_Blue_Mountains , do n't know about this time of year , but they are fantastic to say the least . If you want warmth , take the flight to ENTITY_Carins this is right on the Great Barrier Reef , do a couple of day trips for snorkleing or even diving .

I would hardly call them mountains although it can get cool . I would just pick up brochures from your hotel and decide 24 hrs in advance . The first day you will find plenty to see by just walking around but the Powerhouse museum is a must on the first day . It is interactive so young and old children can enjoy themselves . This will tie up the first day whilst you plan the second .

Well , you can go to mountain tours -LRB- talking about the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains ? -RRB- . Could be a bit rainy - but so what ? Get yourself sturdy shoes and a jumper and if necessary a jacket . Weather never is too bad - the only bad thing might be if you get dressed wrong . It 's late autumn in ENTITY_Australia by this time of the year .

The rest of ENTITY_Sydney is pretty nice , and while it is moving towards winter , temperatures during the day are around 20 at the moment . Sight seeing with the family = Get on a ferry and go to Tarronga Zoo . Also ferry to Manly beach will be cheap and lovely . You could also do the ENTITY_Sydney busses tour to see the city . Some nice museums in the city as well . Heaps of parks and gardens , as well as Darling harbour . Citysearch.com.au is a good starting point .
