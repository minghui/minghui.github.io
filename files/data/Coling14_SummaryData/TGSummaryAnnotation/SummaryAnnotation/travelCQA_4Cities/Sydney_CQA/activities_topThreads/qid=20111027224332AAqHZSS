On New Years Eve they have entertainment, singers and a massive celebration at the Harbour. Also there is a special lights performance on the bridge that you would enjoy. Christmas - Almost the same thing as New Years Eve but it is Carols in the Park ----> website here http://www.canterbury.nsw.gov.au/www/htmâ€?And they provide entertainment. They also have the Carols By CandleLight..... Hope this helps :)
