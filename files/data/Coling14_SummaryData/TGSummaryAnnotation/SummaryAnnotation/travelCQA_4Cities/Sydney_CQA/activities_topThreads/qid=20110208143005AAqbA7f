It would be easy to spend a day around circular quay to Darling harbour there are many eating places and museums etc to take a look at. Also the Rocks area, There's an historical pub there. . One of the days get an all day runabout ticket that takes you on the trains ferries and buses. It's nice to get the ferry to Watsons bay hop off for a while buy some fish and chips there, they are suppose to be real good then get another ferry back also you can get the River Cat to parramatta and the train back if you want. Then off to Bondi for a few hours.

The opera House is free to have a look at, if you like art then walk through the botanical gardens and go and see the art gallery. ALso the Harbour Bridge is next to circular quay as well so you can have a look at that. Circular Quay is where all the ferries disembark from so a trip around the harbour is a must. I recommend going to Manly, takes 30min, costs $6 and you can go for lunch/coffee at Manly and go for a lovely walk around the beach. Bondi is a popular suburb, has a beach, nice cafes.
