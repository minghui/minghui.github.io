It 's a great way to see ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour and is relatively cheap . While you 're at Manly you can eat fish and chips -LRB- or whatever , there are lots of cafes and take away food shops -RRB- for lunch on the beach . You can get all-day travel cards for buses/trains/ferries , so to get value from the tickets plan to use some of the other forms of public transport , even if just travelling around the city centre .

Get the bus back to Circular Quay and walk through the Rocks , under the ENTITY_Harbour_Bridge , round Circular Quay to the Opera house . Day two -LRB- 28th -RRB- go to the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains . Day three -LRB- 29th -RRB- plan a trip to the zoo . It is n't free but it is well worth it . If you have time , check out the Powerhouse Museum , the Maritime Museum or the Australian Museum . On the 30th , go to Manly on the ferry and have a fish and chip lunch on the beach before heading home in the evening .

If they could charge you to breathe they would . Hotels are about $ 99 - $ 200 a night , you can go and see the ENTITY_Opera_House , take a ferry ride for an hour in the harbor for $ 20 per person , and go to the cool zoo they have not sure on the price of that one . Blue mountain tour is $ 99 per person and not free at all . Bus rides are about $ 3.50 per ride , they do n't have transfers here . Each time you get on a bus for another route you have to pay another $ 3.50 per ride . I got the multi pass for a week for an adult is $ 60 and allows you trains and busses . Free is only maybe to take pictures at the ENTITY_Opera_House , The Botanical Garden , and the famous bridge in ENTITY_Sydney , but that is about it . Bring a lot of money my friend you are in for a surprise as I was . I could not believe how expensive this place is . Take care and the best of luck to you . They have ENTITY_Sydney_Hostels in which you share a room with 4-8 other people of the same gender and the least expensive in hotels that I found at about $ 35-65 depending on which one you stay at . The best one is the ENTITY_YHA backpackers hostels .
