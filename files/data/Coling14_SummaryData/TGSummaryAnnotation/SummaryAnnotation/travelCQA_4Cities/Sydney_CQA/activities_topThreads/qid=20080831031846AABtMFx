You could catch a ferry from the Quay across to Manly and grab some fish and chips for lunch. Check out ChinaTown and Paddys Market. Just have fun

CentrePoint tower might appeal to both of you, it's the tallest tower in Australia so that's kind of cool. You could go to Paddy's Markets which is near China Town, or generally shopping is good to do in Sydney. You also might like the Aquarium, i know that might sound a bit lame but it's cool, and near there is Luna Park which is fun for everyone, I'm sure your dad will tell you all of these stories of about when he use to go to Luna Park. If all else fails go for a walk along the beach, they're all so pretty. Have FUN!!!!
