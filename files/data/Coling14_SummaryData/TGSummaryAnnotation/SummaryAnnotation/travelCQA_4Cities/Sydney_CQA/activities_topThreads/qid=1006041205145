There is the ENTITY_Sydney bridge that you can walk across or climb up and over , if you are brave and want to spend the money . Near the end of one of the bridges is a little amusement park that has a ferris wheel and other rides . The sydney tower is the highest point in the city and offers incredible views of the city at night . There is a restaurant there too . If you feel like traveling a few hours , the Blue Mountains are about 3 hours away and it 's definitely worth the trip . You can go on the steepest cable car in the world and see Koalas and Kangaroos . There are also many beaches close by that are worth chccking out as well . ENTITY_Sydney is a fun city and there are many things to do . Stores stay open late downtown , there are many parks , and the people are friendly .
