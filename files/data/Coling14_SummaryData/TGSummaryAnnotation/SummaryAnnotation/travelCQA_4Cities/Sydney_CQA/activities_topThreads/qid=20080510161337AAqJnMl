Even though I live in ENTITY_Sydney , I never get bored of going there . The outside is great ! As you 're walking up the stairs to the top , you can feel a comfortable sea breeze if you 're lucky enough ! Also , after enjoying the great Australian sunlight , stand under the ENTITY_Opera_House for a great photo in the shade ! I 've only been inside once and it 's like no other regular hall or auditorium . Every room there is huge ! You can get lost easily in there lol . I hope you will enjoy your time in ENTITY_Sydney and have fun ! : -RRB-

I love ENTITY_Sydney it 's nice to go and watch a concert at the opera house - or go and drink at opera bar ... you can go to `` The Rocks '' markets and look over at it ... out on a ferry to Manly and see the whole of ENTITY_Sydney 's harbour views ... you may be let down by it , as it 's just a structure ... but with the surroundings it 's quiet beautiful ... and i forget how lucky I am looking at it every day ...

We have also taken the guided tour through the complex -LRB- well worth the money -RRB- . I would recommend going to see a gig in the main concert hall . It is very impressive and surprisingly smaller than it looks in photos and on TV . For a hall that seats a few thousand people , it feels a lot more intimate and every seat has an amazing view . Note : To choose a specific seat in any venue - buy your ticket at the opera house personally . The box office staff have seating plans which you can use to direct exactly where you want to sit -LRB- and shows which seats are already taken -RRB- . The online ticketing just allocates the next available seat , with no choice given . Do remember to book as early as possible . ENTITY_Opera_House tickets often sell out early . Booking 6 months in advance is a good start , even longer for international acts .

It had been very interesting but crowded as we were too many people on this tour . But there always will be lots of visitors on sightseeing tours . But it 's worth it .
