So far we have decided to go to Luna Park, the Zoo, Paddy's markets and we plan on going to more shops (know any good ones?), and we think we will go to the Sydney Kings basketball game on January 8 that night. So, does anyone have any recomendations on where to go and other stuff that you think will be fun? Just some places to go that could be interesting for kids (teenagers), or places that are just relaxing, etc.. Thanks! =)

Have lunch on Woolloomooloo wharf or check out markets at the rocks before hitting pancakes on the rocks. If you want to go to the beach (Which you should) avoid Bondi & Manly, although they are beautiful they will be full of tourists. Instead go to Parsley Bay (On the east) or Long Reef (On the North). If you do go to Bondi, go further up the beach to North Bondi. It's a nicer crowd and you can grab some food and/or a drink from North Bondi Italian. Go for a horse ride or Bike ride through Moore Park & Shopping along Oxford Street in Paddington. Go to Miss Chu's in Darlinghurts for Lunch or Dinner, it is to die for & authentic, then go check out Kings Cross because if your in Sydney you have to see the cross. It may seem dingy but if you pick the right places it is actually a cool scene. Also if your of age visit White Revolver in Bondi on a Wednesday night or 'The Island' on a Weekend, it's where all the best people hang out. There is so much to do here, enjoy Sydney like a local, it's way more fun!

Magistic cruises have a sightseeing option with dining. So i think there is nothing to worry in selecting such a cruise with kids. Also it would be an un forgetable experience.
