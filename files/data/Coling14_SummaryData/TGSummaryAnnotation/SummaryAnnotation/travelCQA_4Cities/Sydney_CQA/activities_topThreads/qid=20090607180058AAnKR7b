Well , I am heading there with a friend and we are already planning doing the following things : Hunter Valley wine tour Whale watching ENTITY_Sydney_Opera_House_Zoo and Aquarium We might do one more thing together , but she has a conference to attend and I will have three full days of self exploring before we do these things . I would like to see ENTITY_Chinatown and have lunch there . If there is anything to see in ENTITY_Chinatown let me know . I also might head out to the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains . What is this cockatoo ? island ? Any special kinds of food or restaurants to try ? I am very adventurous and so is my companion . I 've already had kangaroo and crocodile . Any recommendations are greatly appreciated . I know it 's winter in ENTITY_Australia when I go so I will save the beaches for another trip . I just want this to be a spectacular trip as it is somewhat spontaneous . I just kinda said yes to going to ENTITY_Australia without any ideas on things to do . Thanks .

Then i would wander south along ENTITY_George_Street towards ENTITY_Chinatown - ENTITY_George_St is a nice lively street , there are some really nice restaurants in Spanish quarters along that street . In ENTITY_Chinatown , i liked ENTITY_Paddy 's Markets , and you can have a lunch upstairs in the same building , there is a big food court . But there are also many nice eateries around ENTITY_Dixon_Street . If you get time , i would also visit some nice inner suburbs like ENTITY_Glebe and ENTITY_Newtown , there are some nice cafes there to enjoy , great places to just sit down and do some people-watching and get a feeling of what locals are up to . A trip to ENTITY_Blue_Mountains is easy - 1 hour by train , you can easily spend a day there in ENTITY_Katoomba , see the Three Sisters etc. . .

ENTITY_China town is all about restaurants & markets ... no big deal ! There are large ethnic groups scattered around ENTITY_Sydney ... Italians own ENTITY_Leichhardt , ENTITY_Lebanese_Granville_& the Vietnamese Cabramatta ... if you fancy checking out their restaurants & markets it wo n't be too difficult . If you want to head west to the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains you can do that by train ... just head for the western line & get a ticket to Katoomba ... there are the Jenolan Caves to see there as well as the three sisters ... a rock formation !

Im sorry i cant recommend any specific restaurants to you , but there are lots of nice restaurants in ENTITY_Chinatown . along darling harbour you will also find some nice restaurants , and its a lovely place to take a walk in the early evening . anywhere you go in ENTITY_sydney you will find some nice restaurants , so i recommend just taking a walk and seeing what you find that strikes your fancy . There 's heaps to do in ENTITY_Sydney , so have fun !
