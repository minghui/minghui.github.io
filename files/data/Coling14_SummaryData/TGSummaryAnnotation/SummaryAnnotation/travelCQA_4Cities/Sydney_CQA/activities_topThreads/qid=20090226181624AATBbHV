I'll be spending the better part of two days in Sydney and I'm looking for suggestions of things to do or see. I will be doing the Sydney Harbor Bridge climb on morning. What are the "must-dos" while in Sydney. I may never make it back and I want to be sure not to miss anything important.

Then maybe catch the ferry from Circular Quay to Manly & have some lunch at the Bavarian restaurant on the wharf. Then wander down thru the Corso to get to the main beach. Later in the afternoon, catch the 135 bus up to North Head, and enjoy the view of the sydney harbour. Get the bus back down again, and then catch the ferry back to the city. If are using public transport, opt for a day tripper travel pass. It usually works out to the cheapest option & you can use it on trains, buses & ferries.

A trip on the river cat up to Parramatta is good also over to Manly on the ferry . If you have time go out to Bondi beach . If you can spare an extra day then a day trip to the Blue Mountains is lovely.
