Based on the info you have given , I suggest you budget $ 50-75 / person/day for 3 meals . While the portions are large , they are not as large as in the ENTITY_US either , but you can still share with a companion if you are not a big eaters . A rule of thumb we use when travelling in ENTITY_US is to figure the cost in $ AU/day and halve it . You could work out the amount in $ ENTITY_US and double it and that will give you an indication . Hope you have a great time .

There is no need to spend a fortune on food in ENTITY_Sydney or ENTITY_Melbourne . ENTITY_Google `` Cheap eats in ENTITY_Sydney '' -LRB- or ENTITY_Melbourne -RRB- for web sites listing good but cheap restaurants . Licensed clubs in ENTITY_Sydney usually have good inexpensive meals and good deals are to be found in many pubs . If you prepare your own breakfast , you should be able to do lunch for $ 10 a head if you want a sandwich but no more than $ 15 to $ 20 if you want a sit down meal . Dinner will be about $ 20 to $ 25 a head for a good meal at the right restaurant . Many restaurants have bring-your-own licences so buy a bottle of wine at a nearby bottle shop which will save the big mark-up on restaurant wines . You can splurge on the top restaurants if you want to but careful planning should make meals no more than $ 40 a day . Budget on $ 50 and you will be fine .

When I was over there from ENTITY_Canada , I found their prices on par with us , in some areas cheaper . For two weeks , that is up to you , I got my own breakfast , and for lunch I was happy with a meat pie or two or what they call a pastie . I found the counter lunches at the pubs over there very inexpensive . Also while I was in ENTITY_Sydney , I found two places that made the best fish and chips I have ever had . However , maybe for supper , we would splurge a bit , the seafood over there is to die for , specially those cold seafood platters for two , that alone was about $ 70 , for the two of us . You will go through between $ 500 to $ 1,000 , if your not careful , or if you do n't budget , for two of us , we went through in the oder $ 700.00 for two weeks , but we were over there for much longer than that , so the $ 700 , for two weeks is a rough close enough guesstamation .

I recommend to buy from ENTITY_Aldi as they 're extremely cheap . ENTITY_Woolworths and ENTITY_Coles are average . ENTITY_IGA is extremely expensive , so stay away from them .
