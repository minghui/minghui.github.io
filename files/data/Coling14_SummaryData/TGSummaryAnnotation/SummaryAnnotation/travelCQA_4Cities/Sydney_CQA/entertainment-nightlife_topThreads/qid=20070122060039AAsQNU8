Just pick them up and check them out. If you want the gay scene, which is huge, Oxford St Darlinghurst and King St Newtown are the places to go. They are worth visiting even if you are straight. If you are going to be in Sydney on Saturday 3 March, don't miss the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade from Whitlam Square up Oxford St and Flinders St. You will be joining half a million people to watch the world's biggest gay parade.
