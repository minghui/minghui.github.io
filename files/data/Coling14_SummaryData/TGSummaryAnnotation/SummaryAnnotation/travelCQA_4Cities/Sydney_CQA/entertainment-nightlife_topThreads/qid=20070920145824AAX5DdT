It is clean , friendly , and you do n't always require a car to get around because the public transportation is excellent -LRB- in fact , all this is true for the whole of ENTITY_Australia ! -RRB- However , at the end of the day , it 's all down to personal taste . I would suggest that you go there for a week before you make a full decision on whether you would really like to live there -LRB- if it 's not too late to do so already -RRB- , and keep in mind that it 's quite a pricy place to live .

If ENTITY_Australia is Oz , then ENTITY_Sydney is the ENTITY_Emerald_City - which is the name ENTITY_David_Williamson gave to his play about ENTITY_Sydney . Many migrants start in ENTITY_Sydney . It must be doing something right , most of them stay and it is ENTITY_Australia 's largest city .

When you come to ENTITY_Sydney you will feel as if you have n't left ENTITY_america . We have 15 feet fences sounding the city with razor wire on top , police snipers on top of buildings , identifications papers required to move from one sector to another , mobile phones will not receive/make a call , restaurants only allowed to have plastic knifes , when the fire works are on the harbor you must not watch as the fire works are for the `` Chosen '' few .
