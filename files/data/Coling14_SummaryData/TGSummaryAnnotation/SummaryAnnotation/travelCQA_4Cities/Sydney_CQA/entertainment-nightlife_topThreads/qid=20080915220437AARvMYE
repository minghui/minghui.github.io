It is also very clean and well organised , there is plenty of everything to go round , good quality shopping , good public transport , excellent medical care , clean drinking water , lots of entertainment , excellent schools , colleges and universities and very friendly people . Women are very safe and treated respectfully . Whoever told you there was lots of crime and no safe places for women has either never been here , or came here and got extremely unlucky . It 's very safe .

The main part of ENTITY_Sydney is like most other larger towns , there is crime but only in certain areas and it 's quite a nice place to live . If you think it 's right then go ahead and move there , there are many nice places without much crime .

But generally speaking it is not that bad . I would not worry too much about it . If you do come to ENTITY_Australia , you have to have a good sense of humour , some people will make fun of your accent , just laugh it off and you 'll be right .

I would n't say it is unsafe for girls in fact I think it 's safer for girls then most other large cities . But still of course there is some degree of crime like everywhere in the world .
