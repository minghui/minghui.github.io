Also some sleazy people see a girl by herself in a bar or club and assume that you are looking to get laid and wo n't leave you alone . Clubs can be interesting , just go and dance . In ENTITY_Sydney the club scene moves around all the time . Otherwise what you need to do is start meeting people . Use everything , from the Internet to joining clubs . For example , join a bushwalking club . ENTITY_University_of_Sydney has a good one . You go for a hike and at the end you go to the pub for a drink . Another option is to join volunteer programs , do some politcal activitism and so on . YOu can meet plenty of people your own age . Also consider a sporting club . A social sport , such as tennis , means you can keep fit and get to know others . Anywhere you can meet new people is good , join a language class .
