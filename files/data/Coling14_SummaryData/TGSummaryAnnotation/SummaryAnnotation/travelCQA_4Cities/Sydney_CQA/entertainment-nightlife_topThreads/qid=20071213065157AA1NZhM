This is the driest time of the year and it is warm enough to do all the outdoor things you might want to do. The Olympic Games were held in Sydney in late September/early October to take advantage of the drier weather. Any time is a good time to visit Sydney but it has wet summers and autumns. March is the wettest month but it rains one day in three on average for much of the year. That doesn't mean you won't get long dry spells. The full climatic averages for Sydney are here: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tâ€?The Festival of Sydney is in January starting with the New Years Eve fireworks over the Bridge. There are lots of things to do and free concerts in the Domain every weekend. February is the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival - a month of theatre, music and art followed by the world famous parade at the end of the month. There is an excellent site about things happening in Sydney called "What's on in Sydney" and you will find it here: http://www.whatsoninsydney.com.au

I go in June which is their winter (and is low season for travel, about the cheapest time to fly) and temperatures around 20 degrees C are similar to our Irish early summer. The Sydney hot months January and February can be 35 degrees upwards - much too hot for me. If you like that sort of heat - go then.
