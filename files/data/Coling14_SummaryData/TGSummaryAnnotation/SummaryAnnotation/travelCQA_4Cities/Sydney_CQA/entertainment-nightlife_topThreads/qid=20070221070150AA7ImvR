Unfortunately , because of a bureaucratic bungle , they engaged an ordinary architect instead of a naval architect . The thing was half built before they realised , so they decided to keep going . This is the true reason for the sail-like structures . It is absolutely not true that the architect was inspired by seeing some armadillos in the throes of procreation . These days it is mainly used by skateboarders . The carpark is a really cool double helix ramp .
