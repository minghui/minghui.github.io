Forget about trying to find somewhere without crowds . It 's pretty much standing room only everywhere ! The action is all centred on the eastern side of the harbour bridge although everywhere both sides is just mobbed . If you still can maybe you can get yourself onto one of the many harbour cruise boats . Expensive but they of course limit the number of people and have a front row position . On land the most popular and best vantage point is ENTITY_Mrs_Macquaries_Chair which is the next point back from the ENTITY_Opera_House by the Botanical Gardens although this is definitely the most crowded place . Another very good one that I heard of though is the ENTITY_Cahill_Expressway which is the road that goes above Circular Quay . A great vantage point without too much crowd as in the past they 've limited the numbers there too . I think last year one of the newspapers gave away tickets to get in there but I know other people who were allowed in anyway and they reckon it was fantastic . Do n't be too worried about the crowds , that 's all a part of what ENTITY_NYE in ENTITY_Sydney or anywhere else is all about . But whatever you do - do n't give up and decide to watch it on TV . This is the most spectacular and biggest firework display in the world every year and the TV coverage really somehow makes it look very ordinary . You have to see the real thing if only once in your life .

I would suggest somewhere east towards the entrance to the harbour so that you can take in the bridge and ENTITY_Opera_House as well . And remember to get there early to get a great spot .
