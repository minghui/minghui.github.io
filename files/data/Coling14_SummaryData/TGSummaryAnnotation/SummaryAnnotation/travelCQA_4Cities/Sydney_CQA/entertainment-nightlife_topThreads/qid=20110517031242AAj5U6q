I'd suggest having the party at World Bar, its not too expensive and its one of the few clubs in the whole city where you don't have to scream your lungs out just to talk to the person next to you. They've also got a pretty epic private lounge area you can rent out between two levels middle way up the stairs. The teapots are also a great, fairly cheap novelty. In general the crowd is better than anywhere else I've been. Fairly young, everyones attractive, quite a few backpackers, but mainly laid-back and friendly. None of this stuck up, in your face aggression like at Ivy Good luck with it all Ryan

I would say that your 18th b'day should be one of the most rememberable one in your life. Think some thing different. Try to move to some places that you have not gone before nearby or a little far away with your people. I would suggest you to move to Sydney Harbour. Book a Cruise and am sure that you will have a really good over there. On Last January its was my sister 21st birthday, then I reserved tickets in Magestic Cruises Dinner and had a really good time over there. My sister and all others in family really enjoyed it.. I would recommend do something different mate as its Your special day. There are enumerous venues in Sydney. Actually a flood of Venues. Check out the links below. Hope that would help.
