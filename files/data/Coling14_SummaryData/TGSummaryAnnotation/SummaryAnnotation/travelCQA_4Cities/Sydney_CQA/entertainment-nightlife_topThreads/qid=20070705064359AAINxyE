It depends on what you like so its hard recommending a good place which suits everybodys taste. One of my fav places (not very suitable for an anniversary but a good place to try during your 2 week stay) is Pancakes on The Rocks. Its open 24 hours and the food there is fabulous!! They've got steaks, pizzas, pancakes (not your ordinary pancakes by the way!) and its affordable as well. There are 2 locations THE ROCKS 4 Hickson Rd, The Rocks, Sydney DARLING HARBOUR 229/230 Harbourside Shopping Centre, Darling Harbour (open 7am-12am) you can find a whole list of restaurants and reviews at http://www.eatability.com.au/au/sydney/pâ€?or consult one of those travel books/brochures for the most popular places. Cheap entertainment ideas: Sydney Aquarium and Wildlife world, Chinese gardens, National Maritime Museum, Haymarket, movies, Star City Casino, Chinatown. Baby clothes: you can try Harbourside Darling Harbour (http://www.harbourside.com.au/ )and Market City (http://www.marketcity.com.au/ ) but I don't know if there will be much of what you are looking for. enjoy your stay ;)

Here's some other places you should look at. George St, Parramatta. Catch the train from the City to Parramatta and walk down George St. Pick anywhere in the world you would like to eat and you will find it. Mario's Pizza, Croydon. The best pizza I have ever had. I used to live down the road. Pizza's aren't as good as they used to be, but Mario's is the business. (Just don't tease him about the Roosters this year) Nag's Head Pub, Glebe. There are stacks of pubs with pub grub all over Sydney, but this is my favourite. Cosy atmosphere, good menu and just an all round top pub. Now here's some other quick tips. Portuguese - Go to Petersham Italian - Go to Norton St Leichardt Greek - Go to Marrickville Lebanese - Go to Bankstown Thai - Go to Newtown As for baby clothes, I can't help you there mate. Have fun
