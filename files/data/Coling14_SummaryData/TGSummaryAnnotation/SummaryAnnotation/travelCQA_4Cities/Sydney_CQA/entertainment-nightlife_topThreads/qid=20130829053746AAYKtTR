There are plenty of events and activities you should take part during the holiday including Christmas Parties, Concerts, Santa Festival, Xmas Shopping, Karaoke, Xmas Lights Projections... Remember to reserve early your restaurants, hotels and festival spots to avoid last-minute disappointment.

Most of the big hotels in Sydney do a special Christmas lunch as do some of the restaurants. Various companies such as Captain Cook Cruises (Google "Christmas lunch Sydney harbour") do a cruise round the harbour on Christmas day with lunch. If you are young and want a picnic, head to Bondi Beach and join the many backpackers and visitors from all over the world spending Christmas day there. If you want a religious Christmas all religions are catered for with major services in St Mary's (Catholic) and St Andrew's (Anglican) cathedrals. Apart from Christmas Day, google "What's on in Sydney" and check some of the web sites. here's the City of Sydney site http://whatson.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/ If you are in Sydney for New Years Eve, don't miss the fireworks over the Harbour Bridge. get a good viewing spot during the afternoon and have a party til midnight.

I assume you will be there for the New Years Eve Festivities on Sydney Harbor, that is a must not to miss. What do you do back home for Christmas? I went to the special service at St Mary's in Sydney, it was so uplifting, and I am not a church going person. I heard a lot of hype about this special service, so I went to check it out, I'm glad I did. I during my time working in Sydney, obviously I made a few Australian friends, who, invited me to join them for Christmas, and another had a New Years spread, of man, it's non stop food. I am used to a white Christmas, sunny Christmas, absolutely awesome.
