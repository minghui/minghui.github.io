qid=20070722154412AA2hgYR_answer_1	1	qid=20070722154412AA2hgYR	2007-07-23 03:37:35	best_answer	 Hi there - I 'm from ENTITY_America -LRB- was born there many moons ago -RRB- but loved ENTITY_Australia so much I moved here ! Good places to eat - they are everywhere in ENTITY_Sydney . We get some of the best produce in the world here , so the quality is superb . Ask locally in the area of ENTITY_Sydney where you are for the day , or just have a look as you walk past cafes on the street . ENTITY_Sydney is a huge place , so where you eat depends a lot on what part of ENTITY_Sydney you are in ! Hotels - I use places like wotif.com or lastminute.com.au to book if I 'm looking for a hotel . They let you book a few weeks in advance , and you get a much better deal than you would if you just rang the hotel and asked . If you 're staying in ENTITY_Sydney , I 'd recommend staying near Darling Harbour , the Rocks/opera house , or in some of the areas close to Town Hall/CBD . From those areas you can get trains , ferries , and monorails to move anywhere within the city , and the main area of ENTITY_Sydney is so easy to move around in anyway that you could walk almost anywhere ! Shopping - again , lots of great shops . I love the QVB -LRB- Queen Victoria Building -RRB- which is very near Town Hall in the city . It is a beautiful old building , and there are shops there that are anywhere from bargain basement -LRB- in the basement , actually -RRB- to boutique . THe higher you go in the building , the more expensive the shops ! Take a harbour ferry or two ... or eight ... while you 're there - great way to move around the city , and much cheaper than a harbour cruise . You can get very good value passes that give you access to ferries , trains , buses , etc for a day . Other than that - have fun ! I 'm really not a city person , but ENTITY_Sydney is honestly one of the very best cities in the world !
