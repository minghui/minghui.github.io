I 'm a former resident of ENTITY_Brisbane and I had to travel to ENTITY_Sydney near Christmas last year . Check the train schedules first - they 're available online . Take one that is about 15-20 minutes after your plane is due to land . Go to circular Quay . Hop out and head downstairs ; you 'll be in a big tourist place . If you walk along the boardwalk , you 'll see the bridge on the left . Keep going , and the ENTITY_Opera_House is right in front of you . There 's cafes lining the area , so getting breakfast would n't be hard , unless you want the quick 'n' dirty and there 's a ENTITY_McDonalds as well as a few other places in the airport . Hop back on a train about an hour before your plane is due to go .

From there it is minutes to the ENTITY_Opera_House and the bridge . Solid place for breakfast in the Rocks area -LRB- ten minute walk -RRB- is Pancakes On The Rocks 4 ENTITY_Hickson_Rd. .

ENTITY_Sydney_Airport is jam packed with shops and restaurants both in the international and domestic terminals .

And apart from it being expensive i also found it a bit on the dull side -LRB- Apart from ENTITY_NYE_Fireworks -RRB- To be truth full you are not going to see much of ENTITY_Sydney or whatever in five hours . On the top floor above ENTITY_Paddy 's Indoor Market is a floor dedicated to all types of cuisine -LRB- ENTITY_Chinese etc -RRB- I would prefer to sample these rather than running round like a blue a@@ed fly .
