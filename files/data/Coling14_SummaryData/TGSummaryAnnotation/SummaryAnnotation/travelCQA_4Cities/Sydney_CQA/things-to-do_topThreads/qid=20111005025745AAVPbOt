Then for the evening take a supper cruise of the harbor on the ENTITY_John_Cadman_Cruising restaurants , see the harbor at night under lights , and enjoy a great meal . The next day . We were told to check out the zoo , and me being a mere male , naturally said , seen one zoo seen them all , but not with the zoo in ENTITY_Sydney , they way they have set that up is awesome , you need another day to get through there , and you can get there by ferry . Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes .

Wander around Darling harbour circular quay to The Rocks and opera house , There is plenty to see and do on the way maybe you can have a meal in ENTITY_China town I walked there from circular quay which is not far through a park . Get the ferry to watsons bay or The river Cat to ENTITY_parramatta . for a look at the harbour and water ways . a day at ENTITY_Bondi_Beach would also be good .

It ends with a big free concert in the Domain and fireworks on the Bridge .
