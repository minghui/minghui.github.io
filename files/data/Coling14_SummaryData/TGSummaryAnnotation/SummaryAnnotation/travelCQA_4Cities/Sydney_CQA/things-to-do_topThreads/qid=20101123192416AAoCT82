In the rocks hands out my favorite place was ENTITY_Cargo_Bar , Home nightclub is also really cool has a young crowd because they advertise a lot at various uni and they have awesome drink specials usually a 2 shot , a four dollar beer , and one drink that is on discount . The Ivy is nice , but if you really into dancing I would n't go there the dance floor is tiny , and it usually full of people talking more than anything . Do n't go to ENTITY_Kings_Cross , I liked it but it is seedy , full of hookers , drug takers , and people who look filthy rich and almost ever bar or club has a cover on a normal night who know how much they would charge on New years .

For tourists there are a number of popular bars in the Rocks area -LRB- eg ENTITY_Australia Hotel -RRB- . ENTITY_George street has a number of bars . ENTITY_Newtown is good for bars . I wo n't go into much more detail simply because on New Year 's eve it all changes . I hate going out on new year 's eve , because everyone goes out . Which means all the boring people go out as well -LRB- no vibe -RRB- . There will probably be a concert in a park -LRB- like ENTITY_Hyde park -RRB- that you can attend for free . Fireworks will be at 9 and at 12midnight -LRB- first one for the kiddies -RRB- . Hard to find any spot to see the fireworks unless you go early . Consider booking tickets on a booze cruise so you are in the middle of the harbour on a disco boat .
