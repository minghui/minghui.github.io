Most authentic ENTITY_Chinatown in ENTITY_Australia IMO . Go there on a friday night , they have lots of cheap market stalls to eat from as well , you 'd be forgiven for thinking you were in a ENTITY_Hong_Kong night market . To get to ENTITY_Chinatown , you take either the train -LRB- to Central -RRB- , the monorail -LRB- to ENTITY_Chinatown or Paddys Market -RRB- , or the light rail -LRB- to Capitol Square -RRB- . Another good place to go is ENTITY_Cabramatta , lots of ENTITY_Asian restuaraunts and shops . Best to go here for lunch , this neighbourhood is not too safe at night . To get there , the South , ENTITY_Bankstown , Inner West and ENTITY_Cumberland train lines all stop at ENTITY_Cabramatta . ENTITY_Newtown is also great for cheap eats , lots of cusines available , and a lot of students , as it is close to the main university . To get there , take the ENTITY_South or Inner West train lines to ENTITY_Newtown , or the ENTITY_Bankstown line to ENTITY_St_Peters .

I would suggest going to one of the eating streets . For students it is usually King st in ENTITY_Newtown , with lots of restaurants , cafes and bars . Many of the pubs become more night clubish at night on weekends . ENTITY_China town is good too , but not the main street -LRB- where it is hard to find any real chinese food , as it is mostly Japanese , ENTITY_vietnam and other asian countries -RRB- but in the surrounding area . Also ENTITY_Ashfield is a great place for ENTITY_Chinese food , burwood is very multicultural with one of the best chinese bakeries I know . Head to Manly or ENTITY_Bondi for some fish and chips on the beach -LRB- though they are heading a bit into the gourmet price range these days you should still be able to get some classic fish and chips -RRB- . Darlinhurst tends to be the niteclub and bar area -LRB- including drag clubs , gay bars , regular bars , ENTITY_nite clubs and everything you could possibly imagine -RRB-
