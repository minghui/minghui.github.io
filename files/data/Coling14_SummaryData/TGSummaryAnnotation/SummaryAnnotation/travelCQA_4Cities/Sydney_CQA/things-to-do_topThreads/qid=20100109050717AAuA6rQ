The only time you would n't have a choice was if you had a `` set menu '' thing . This applies in movie / meal deals -LRB- eg you pay $ 30 and get a movie ticket to a particular cinema and then have the choice of two entrees and two mains -RRB- or a similar set menu deal . 2 -RRB- It depends on the area . Follow the usual safety options , stay in well lit areas etc. . Talk to your hotel staff , they will know the area or may have some options for you ... 3 -RRB- Shorts are still able to be worn ...

ENTITY_Sydney is no different , and a lot can happen in 300m . Go to the movies in a group or see a movie during the daytime . 3 . Yes it is hot in ENTITY_Sydney now until March .

Yes you can order just a main course or even just an appetiser at a restaurant without having to have 3 course meals . There are also plenty of cheap restaurants around plus ENTITY_Asian restaurants too in ENTITY_Sydney . 2 . No it is quite safe for you to go to the movies on your own . The movie theatres in ENTITY_Sydney are quite luxurious and modern and generally have several theatres screening different movies at the same time . 3 .

So long as the restaurant is n't really nice , most people wo n't order three courses anyway ... 2 . Going and seeing a movie is fine , despite popular opinion , attacks are rare in ENTITY_Australia , pretty much all of them are widely reported in the media and we only hear about one a week across the entire country ... 3 . It was almost 35 degrees here today , so definitely warm enough for shorts ... You 'd cook if you wore pants ... Hope you have a great time visiting our great city : -RRB-

They wont force you to buy anything . . 2 -RRB- Going alone for a movie is not a good idea from my point of view . . It will be crowded and all . . 3 -RRB- Temperature in ENTITY_sydney is too high since summer here , so wearing shots is bit tough these days . I can give you some suggestions regarding the fun things to do in ENTITY_sydney like opera house , ENTITY_sydney habour bridge climb , dinner cruise and cabaret show in ENTITY_sydney harbour , ENTITY_sydney aquarium , ENTITY_Luna park , sydney Tower , etc. . .
