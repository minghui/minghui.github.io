My husband and I will be traveling to ENTITY_Australia for only about 5 days . There are a lot of places we want to go but have no idea how to get to any of them ! Just wondering if theres is a bus system there or should we rent a car ?

If you rent a car do n't forget you 'll be driving on the `` wrong '' side of the road and in ENTITY_Sydney proper this is extremely hazardous . I did it and spent half the time lost . The local airlines like virgin blue have very cheap flights to many destinations throughout the country . Have fun !

qid=20070519201755AALIzNf_answer_6	2	qid=20070519201755AALIzNf	2007-05-20 05:53:07	answer	 You can see a LOT of ENTITY_Sydney in five days using public transport , which is extremely affordable . There are also a multitude of tour operators which do extensive day tours during which you can really get a good idea of what ENTITY_Sydney is like . ENTITY_Sydney is great to drive around if you have a good map and avoid the peak hours at either end of the day which turn the city into a giant car park , so hiring a car to negotiate the sights really depends on how much of your holiday you want to spend in traffic . If you are staying in ENTITY_Sydney 's central area you can walk everywhere , and the walking is pleasant and interesting . Beyond the CBD , however , you will need to use transport to get to most places ! Most of the city rail stations will take you easily to desitinations further out , and the rail system itself is quite extensive : http://www.cityrail.info/ Very affordable and accessible ` quick tours ' can include trips around the ENTITY_Harbour and waterways aboard a Ferry or Cat : http://www.sydneyferries.info/ There is also a bus network : http://www.sydneybuses.info/ plus a tram -LRB- light rail -RRB- service and a monorail : http://www.metromonorail.com.au/ The goevrnment networks -LRB- rail , bus and ferry -RRB- have ticket packages which allow you to travel on all systems , but you must pre-pay for all tickets . You can not buy tickets on board . If you 'd like information about tour operators , you could contact : http://seesydney.com.au Hope you have a wonderful holiday ! : - -RRB-

Get on and off where you choose . There is a red Explorer bus that travels a circuit round most of the places of note near the city . Again buy a ticket and get on or off as you choose . There are some wonderful walks in ENTITY_Sydney if you enjoy walking . I would recommend two particularly : Observatory ENTITY_Hill and the Rocks . Start at Circular Quay and walk up to ENTITY_George_St past the old cottage . Walk up ENTITY_Argyle_St through the Argyle Cut to the Garrison Church then cross the road to the stairs and walk up to the top of ENTITY_Observatory_Hill . After the Observatory , follow the road down the hill and cross the main road to the ENTITY_Lord_Nelson_Hotel . Walk back towards the ENTITY_Garrison_Church , turn left to the Hero of ENTITY_Waterloo Hotel . -LRB- You have now had a drink in Sydneys two oldest pubs -RRB- . Follow the road down to the Bridge and walk back along ENTITY_George_St to the Quay . The other walk starts under the Bridge at Dawes Point and follows the shore past the ENTITY_Overseas_Passenger_Terminal . the ENTITY_Museum_of_Contemporary_Art , Circular Quay , the ENTITY_Opera_House , the Botanic Gardens and ends at ENTITY_Mrs_Macquarie 's Chair . There are many more but those two are particularly good on a fine day . Enjoy your visit .
