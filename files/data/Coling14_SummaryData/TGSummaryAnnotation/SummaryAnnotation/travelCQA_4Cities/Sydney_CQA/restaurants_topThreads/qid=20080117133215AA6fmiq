Firstly is there a shop somewhere around central Sydney where you can buy cheap(er) quality make-up? I mean like a parallel import store or an outlet store. Secondly, around central Sydney where is a good place to buy gourmet foods especially cheeses (goat cheese, camembert etc.)?? Also what days are the Paddington markets open?? Thanks for your help :)

I'll expand: Cheaper quality makeup: Priceline, there is a huge store in Pitt St Mall (opp the Myers), also one in Broadway Shopping Centre (highest floor, around the corber from Target). Alternatively, try pharmacies, they usually have cheaper brands of makeup (but they will cost less in Priceline). Also Price Attack (again, there ins one in Pitt St Mall, go in the Centre Point tower building, food court level, opposite the Maccas). Try Kmart/Target for cheap make up also. You woould usually find these stores in shopping centres (closest to te cbd is probably Broadway shopping centre, it has both). Gourmet Food, def David Jones. There is a specialty cheese store also in the GPO (Martin Place, look for the old post office-really huge building near asx-downstairs in the food court). You could try Leichhardt (catch a 436/438 from the city or anyone that goes down Parramatta Rd and walk to Norton-ask the driver where to get off) it's very close to the cbd (about 10 mins on the bus). Norton St has many deli type Italian stores. Try the Norton St Grocer located in the Coles Building on Norton St, bottom level. Just ask. If you are in the Bondi area, they have a Norton St Grocer in the Westfields but it tends to have less variety. Not sure about Paddy's, just google it! Good luck

I don't know the name of the shop but it is next door to Woolworths Metro, and they are always using a speaker system to tell you their low prices. $1 for toothbrushes, etc.....

Myer or David Jones would have to largest range to choose from.
