You can get a full breakfast from $ 4 . Must pubs in ENTITY_Sydney have $ 5 steaks with a salad & baked potato and it 's top quality . I love ENTITY_Sydney as one night you can have Indian , the next Thai , then German , Greek , African , ENTITY_South_America , Mexican , name a country and there 's a restaurant or Cafe . The more higher the class the more expensive . Most are ENTITY_BYO , or have alcohol . There are those ENTITY_US restaurants like ENTITY_Hungry_Jacks , ENTITY_Macdonald 's , ENTITY_Taco_Bell , ENTITY_Wendy_'s . I 'd stick with the cafe 's as the food is top class and most of the time to much to eat they all also have really yummy deserts and coffee 's . Your not required to tip if I really loved the service I do .

Of course if you order any drinks you will pay closer to the higher mark . Seafood platters vary from 150 - 300 AUD but you can share them . However if you chose to go to take away shop or chinese shop you may spend up to 30 AUD per person .

I think some of the amounts already posted are a little steep ; I usually spend about $ 30 a head -LRB- although this is by no means at a high-end restaurant -RRB- . There 's a big variety , but internationally , I tend to find it pretty equal ; the quality , however , is on the whole much higher , especially for Seafood and ENTITY_International_Cuisine .

qid=20080121101633AAamo86_answer_6	2	qid=20080121101633AAamo86	2008-01-25 06:10:04 +0000	answer	 Disagree with the first response aswell . In my opinion it all depends on your budget . You could get a feast of asian/thai/african / japanese along the newtown strip and walk out not having spent over 80-100 for a two person banquet including drinks , On the other hand if your budget is on the high end , I have personally dropped nearly a thousand at ENTITY_Sydney 's Tetsuya 's for two ppl !!! The thing I love about ENTITY_Sydney is you can get absolutely mind blowing food and pay $ 10 for a main in the back streets of marickville or along king street , OR you can pay 40-60 dollars for a main and get another experience . hope that helps !
