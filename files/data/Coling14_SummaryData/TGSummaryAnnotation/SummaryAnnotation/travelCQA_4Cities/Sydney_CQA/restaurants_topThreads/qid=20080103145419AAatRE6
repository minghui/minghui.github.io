It helps you find nighclubs per specific types of music. Good luck

The bars in the area don;t really tend to do much rnb but are mostly house music, live bands, funky beats. The places like Bungalow 8, Cargo Bar, Loft are the best. Pontoon really sux, you might find some rnb from like 1995 there but the place is truely crap. If you want rnb best trying the city clubs, or Goodbar on Oxford. Polifia's suggestion isgood, go to that website, I've used it before.
