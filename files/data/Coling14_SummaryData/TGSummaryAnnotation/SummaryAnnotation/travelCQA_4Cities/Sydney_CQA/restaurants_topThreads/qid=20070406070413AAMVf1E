There is a great variety of excellent food at modest prices -LRB- under 10.00 for a meal -RRB- available . We enjoy the expensive digs , but we generally seek out the inexpensive ones , and have never been disappointed by the food quality or price . -LRB- As an aside , the most disappointing meal I have ever had in ENTITY_Sydney was at one of the places at The Rocks that has an international reputation . We paid over 70.00 apiece for a meal that came out cold and overcooked . I will neither name the resteraunt , nor return there in the future . -RRB- Why pay and arm and a leg for good food , when you can get by for much less , and have a great meal ?

In most you do n't need to book , if the one you pick is full , there will be an equally good one next door . Browse , check the menus and prices as you stroll up the street .
