Here are 8 things why Sydney is a great place to live: 1. The weather is mild. It doesn't get too hot nor too cold as much as other cities do because of its location - not too far north or south along the coast. 2. It has great shopping - home to quite a few of Australia's largest shopping centres. 3. Since it is Australia's largest city, many events are held here such as concerts/tours. One recent example was World Youth Day 2008 in July. 4. It is very multicultural. If you like to have a taste of what other cultures do or what they eat, there are many places to do so. 5. There are many great places to visit surrounding Sydney if you want a day away which isn't too far such as the Blue Mtns west, the Hunter Valley north and the South Coast/Highlands south. 6. Contrary to common belief, it is actually a safe city to live in compared to other cities around the world. The crime rates are not as high. 7. If you wish to attend Uni, then Sydney is home to a few of Ausralia's oldest and finest Unis such as USyd and UNSW. 8. There are many communities in Sydney which suit different lifestyles. Whether you like to live in a quiet neighbourhood or the opposite - if you have kids or not and your age. Also, there are lots to see and do for everyone! :) Hope this helps! :)

For a start, it's geographically isolated from the real world. Secondly, its lacks the lively & exciting atmosphere that you would find in New York, Tokyo, London or Dubai. Choose another city....
