ENTITY_Bondi_Junction is great - not the main mall , which is just the same high street stores at huge prices , but the pedestrian precinct next to the interchange and all the smaller shops around that area . There is a great open air market there too . You can get some REAL bargains in that area . Otherwise , try little shops in poorer areas like ENTITY_Marrickville or western ENTITY_Sydney . The big name shops will always rip you off wherever you are .

The areas around chinatown also have some great shops as well . To be honest , ENTITY_Sydney is still cheaper than the ENTITY_UK anyway .
