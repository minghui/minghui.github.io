Here 's my theory having eaten at lots of places in each city . ENTITY_Sydney has an abundance of fresh produce at its finger tips and a very developed cafe culture so you can find fantastic cafe style meals nearly anywhere . ENTITY_London really does n't do this type of lower end gourmet food well , instead it offers relatively high quality ` quick food ' chains like Pret A Manger , EAT and a number of others . Gastropubs are taking off again in ENTITY_London which is fantastic because its revitalizing the casual dining scene after it got dumbed down heavily by large pub chain kitchens which offered nothing but processed fish and chips etc. . ENTITY_Sydney has also recently witnessed a renewed effort from pubs to offer good quality meals , this is mostly spurred on by the increases in tax on ENTITY_Poker_Machines which have been such a cash-cow that many pubs got lazy and half of them removed their kitchen all together ! Some of the best ENTITY_Sydney pubs have restaurant quality meals . At the top end you will find that ENTITY_Sydney tends to lean towards super fresh ingredients that are lightly touched by the cooking and arrangement so that natural flavours and textures prevail . This is probably influenced by the glorious produce they have on hand and a willingness to embrace a mix of techniques and recipes from their highly multicultural population . In ENTITY_London you will find that they draw upon long standing recipes from both ENTITY_Europe and the ENTITY_UK . Many of the recipes and techniques have long and involved processes and their use of preserved ingredients is far more prevalent . ENTITY_London does also have many influences from their multicultural population but you do n't tend to see the techniques or ingredients merging , they tend to stick to their own silo . I would say that the standout cuisine at the moment in each city would be : High end Tapas in ENTITY_Sydney Modern European in ENTITY_London Personally I think ENTITY_Sydney is better for day to day food , and both cities are great for fine dining though in very different ways . Favourite ingredients for each city : ENTITY_Sydney - the whole gamut of seafood ENTITY_London - game - especially duck
