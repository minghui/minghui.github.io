The food is OK but not terribly authentic and it is the most ridiculously priced Thai food I 've ever had -LRB- AUD38 for one dish , average price in ENTITY_Sydney would be about AUD10 -RRB- . There are some nice restaurants in East Circular Quay -LRB- ie a short stroll from the Rocks around the harbour - go past the ferry terminals and head toward the ENTITY_Opera_House -RRB- . Ca n't think of the names of any I 've been to there but there is a whole row of restaurants with tables on the waterfront where you can sit and watch the ENTITY_Harbour_Bridge , the ENTITY_Opera_House and the ferries whizzing by -LRB- just choose on which suits your budget as they 're all pretty good -RRB- . An evening harbour cruise would also be nice . They usually have a seafood buffet or something and you can find ones that do have jazz nights etc. . In ENTITY_Port_Douglas , there is a place on Macrossan Street -LRB- ie the main street -RRB- that does great wood fired pizza . Ca n't think of it 's name but it is a little whole-in-the-wall place that mostly does take away but which has a few tables on the sidewalk -LRB- it 's not far from ENTITY_Coles heading toward the beach -RRB- .
