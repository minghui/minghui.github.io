As for things to do take a ride on the Ferries , visit the Aquarium at Darling Harbour -LRB- good Restuarants there -RRB- and the Zoo , climb the Bridge.Go to the beaches if coming in Spring / Summer . If coming in Winter / Autumn take a trip to the mountains and ride the Cable Car at ENTITY_Katoomba . There are many things that you can do depending on your taste .

Go to the two major restaurant areas close to the city - ENTITY_Darlinghurst , along ENTITY_Oxford_Street , and ENTITY_Newtown , along King Street . You can find restaurants with excellent food and good prices all along those streets - ENTITY_Newtown probably has the better choice , ENTITY_esp the ENTITY_Thai restaurants . Further out from the city , about 7 kms away is ENTITY_Leichhardt , with its huge choice of Italian restaurants along ENTITY_Norton_Street . But you 'll need to get there by taxi . Try these areas and you ca n't go wrong !
