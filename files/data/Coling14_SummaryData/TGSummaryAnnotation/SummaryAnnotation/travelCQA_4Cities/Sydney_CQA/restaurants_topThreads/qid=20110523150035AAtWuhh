You could hire a houseboat for a weekend , check out holidaysafloat.com , that I will never forget . You can do your zoo , the opera house , aquarium . I found out of the city , north to your ENTITY_Central_Coast , or South to areas like ENTITY_Woolongong or ENTITY_Kiama -LRB- hope I spelt these right -RRB- . because of that 9 year old , out of ENTITY_Kiama there is or was this great amusement park with giant water slides . Another place I found fascinating was a suburb that was just about totally ENTITY_Asian , the restaurants may not have been spotless , but the food was tremendous . Two places I remember was Super Luck and ENTITY_Goodyear restaurants , very affordable . But hey , I 'm an outsider , do your thing .

I am sure you can make your friends stay very comfortable and the most memorable one.It 's a beautiful place and there are plenty of activities for them to do in Sydney.Few of the places of interest are The ENTITY_Opera_House , Tower and ENTITY_Oz_Trek , Aquarium , Wild life world , ENTITY_Blue_Mountains , guided tours etc Dont miss out on the ENTITY_Harbour dinning and the ENTITY_Harbour_Cruises.It 's really worth it and she and a family will really have an awesome time .

Please do not go to Parklea markets , especially not with a tourist . Best ever ... the Bridge Climb . That is totally the best thing they 'll do in ENTITY_Sydney . Expensive but worth it . An inexpensive and lovely day is to catch the ferry from Manly or Toronga Zoo to Circular Quay , then do your thing around the Rocks and the ENTITY_Opera_House . Then get someone to pick you up from the city or just catch the train home . Get them to see a theatre show or something at the ENTITY_Opera_House . We take our visitors for a pre-theatre dinner at the Opera Bar below the ENTITY_Opera_House . It 's great fun and reasonably priced .

They have good markets at the weekend and Great views of the ENTITY_Opera_House . Go to the tourist informationand pick up their booklet - you can then do their tours at a fraction of the cost .

The stuff there is trashy to say the least.For shopping I suggest the DFOs -LRB- direct factory outlets -RRB- at ENTITY_Homebush_&_Birkenhead Point.Top brands for a small price.Centrepoint for shopping & eating in the tower restaurant . A bridge climb , the botanical gardens , the ENTITY_Opera_House , ENTITY_Darling_Harbour etc. .
