Add to this our large ENTITY_Indian population and you 've got a ready made clientele . Here are some links which may be of use : http://www.vnv.org.au/site/ -LRB- this is the original veg society of victoria website , still full of information -RRB- http://www.vegetarianvictoria.org.au/ -LRB- this is the new site -RRB- . May I suggest that you look into ENTITY_Melbourne 's inner western suburbs as a possible venue - easily accessible for everyone -LRB- especially me ! -RRB- , a younger population , cheaper rents , ENTITY_Footscray is a known food area -LRB- especially ethnic -RRB- , large ENTITY_Indian population , and we only have Lentil As Anything -LRB- google this if you have n't heard of it - it operates a bit like a soup kitchen -RRB- and a Vietnamese buddhist veg restaurant that closes at 7pm , so there 's plenty of room for a vegan restaurant . Having said all this though , any of the capital cities would embrace a veg restaurant . Edit : ENTITY_Victoria is called the Garden State -LRB- Botanic Gardens and lots of other established parks -RRB- , and we are ENTITY_Australia 's food capital and arts capital with wonderful venues - we just do n't have a monorail or opera house .

Vegans make up a small percentage of the population so the bigger the city , the more vegans there will be . This means that ENTITY_Sydney then ENTITY_Melbourne are the most vegan friendly . Inner suburbs of ENTITY_Sydney like ENTITY_Glebe , ENTITY_Newtown and Paddington would be ideal spots for a vegan restaurant and there are one or two there already . `` Vegan '' , by the way , is very off-putting to non-vegans . Call it `` vegetarian '' and you will increase the number of potential customers . I would not go to a vegan restaurant but would go to a vegetarian one even though it was selling vegan food .

As for Vegans , you will not find them isolated in just one area , just like down there in ENTITY_States , and up here in ENTITY_Canada , they are everywhere . ENTITY_Sydney is a beautiful city , know it well , but do yourself a favor , tour and see the richness of the country , dive the ENTITY_Great_Barrier_Reef , go to ENTITY_Darwin and travel from ENTITY_Darwin to ENTITY_Alice_Springs through beautiful areas like ENTITY_Kakadu and ENTITY_Manaranka . Meet real Aborigines in the outback . Taste the exquisit wines of the ENTITY_Borrosa_Valley and also the ENTITY_Hunter_Valley_in_NSW , your Vegan so I suppose sea food is out for you . Girl you do n't know what your missing . Make sure you save real hard .

The labelling in ENTITY_Melbourne is very clear-it is very clear if you are buying vegan , vegetarian or gluten free etc. . There are loads of vegan restaurants and even the normal restaurants put V 's beside vegan dishes . Next i would say is ENTITY_Adelaide . Plenty of vegan restaurants-mainly Indian .

I live in ENTITY_Ipswich which is one of the more bogan areas of the country and about the last place ANYBODY would expect such a venue to be successful . A bit over a year ago ago a organic cafe/grocery store opened up in one of the worst suburbs and it has been more successful than ANYBODY would have imagined . They have a lot of vegan options on their menu . As to the things you think make ENTITY_Sydney a great place to live - the only thing ENTITY_Sydney has that you wo n't find in the other cities -LRB- yes , even ENTITY_Ipswich ! -RRB- is the suspended train . We have botanical gardens , opera and drag queens with a 15 minute drive of our house . A bit more travel is required for the Aquariums but they are still accessible !

My advice would be to come here on a working holiday visa & sample what the joint has to offer before making too many plans for the future . . Once you have a feel for the place you 'll be better able to make these types of decisions . .

Also the big cities are filled with Hippies like our friend ENTITY_Eartha who is also here on ENTITY_Yahoo . They eat vegan . I like ENTITY_Sydney and ENTITY_Melbourne .
