Most people have picnics around the foreshore in places like Milsons Point , ENTITY_Blues_Point , Circular Quay , ENTITY_Bradley 's Head etc. . http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/nye/Vâ€?Other options are finding someone who has a view and is having a party .

Really , just do n't . There are tons of road closures on New Years Eve , parking is very restricted as well as being hugely in demand . Scope out your public transport options ahead of time , and allow plenty of time for delays . Generally they offer a discount ticket on ENTITY_NYE , which is a fantastic deal -- usually around $ 5 or so , unlimited bus-train-ferry travel until some generous hour the next day . -LRB- or just finish your night with a nap on the grass at ENTITY_McMahon 's Point and head home later in the morning . I guarantee you wo n't be the only one snoozing there -RRB-

If this is what you want to do let me give you a run down based on my experiences : The North Side - ENTITY_McMahon 's Point - End of Blues Point Road The view is from the back side of the bridge and can be just as good as the front side of the bridge . One year , bad luck meant that the wind blew the firework smoke to that side meaning that we could n't see from half way through the fireworks , however it is a straight on view and close up of the bridge . To get there walk from ENTITY_North_Sydney Station . ENTITY_Mrs_Macquarie 's Chair Apart from a friend 's apartment this is my favourite place . The vibe is great and the view is breathtaking . Circular Quay I do n't recommend this area based on my experience . I had a great view while I was waiting a few hours till midnight ... then the ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour_Ferries came into the quay and stayed , blocking the view of the bridge . It was most disappointing . Christison Park The view is from a distance , but it is fantastic . The good places here will go very quickly . You can see the view from this picture I found in flickr - http://au.images.search.yahoo.com/imagesâ€?What time to get there ? My suggestion is to forget about the 9pm ` family ' fireworks as they are nowhere near as good and you have to battles with the families to get a spot early . Instead , head to one of the vantage points AFTER 9pm . I have found great views even as late as 10pm . However , once the areas are full , police close them off , so try to get there around 9.30 when the families are leaving . I usually take a picnic backpack , the ones that have room for some BBQ chicken and come with plates , cutlery and a wine cooler . That way you do n't have to pay the inflated prices and you can chill out while waiting .
