This is just off ENTITY_Oxford_Street . Well recommended . If you want something different in the suburbs then go to the 18 footer in ENTITY_Double_Bay , right on the water . You have to be a member if local , but if visiting they will sign you in . Another option is to go to ENTITY_Watson 's Bay for the famous fish and chips . You can choose the restaurant , the pub or eat them in your hand on the wall . ENTITY_Doyles is also opposite the ENTITY_Opera_House , and you get great views there . For a drink and the best view in ENTITY_Sydney go the bar on the 35th floor of the Shangri-La Hotel in the Rocks.Drinks a little pricey but a stunning view . The staff move people around to give them chance of a window seat . Have a great time
