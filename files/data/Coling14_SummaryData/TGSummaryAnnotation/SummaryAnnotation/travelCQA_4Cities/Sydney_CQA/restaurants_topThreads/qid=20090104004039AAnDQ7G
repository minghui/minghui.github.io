There are a few arcades that have some cheap take outs . The other place is in the centre of the city under ENTITY_Centrepoint tower . There is a huge eating area and you can grab something and watch corporate ENTITY_Sydney during their lunch hour . Try to avoid The Rocks and Circular Quay for something to eat . It will be very expensive and touristy . Try looking at this site http://www.visitnsw.com/Cheap_eats_in_Syâ€?or www.eatability.com.au and look up the following areas ENTITY_Newtown Erskeneville ENTITY_Glebe_Leichardt_Dulwich_Hill_Bondi Read the reviews to get an idea of what other people think .

Really , many ENTITY_Sydney people eat out a lot , and the centre of town and all the inner and beach suburbs abound with take-away joints , cafes and restaurants . Some of the suburbs a little further out have particular ethnic orientations food-wise : ENTITY_Leichhardt_&_Haberfield â€ Italian ENTITY_Petersham â€ Portuguese ENTITY_Auburn â€ Turkish Kingsford â€ various ENTITY_Asian -LRB- for the big student population at ENTITY_UNSW -RRB- ENTITY_Bankstown â€ various ENTITY_Middle_Eastern ; ENTITY_Asian_Cabramatta â€ Vietnamese ... etc. . I 'm sure people at the various backpacker hangouts will be able to give you local information . You wo n't go hungry !

Speaking of ENTITY_Spanish , I loooove ENTITY_Casa_Asturiana , just near the Sanctuary and have lovely Tapas . . Also , try ENTITY_Newtown for a good range of cheap to pricey eats , we got a banquet for 4 at a place called ENTITY_Tamanas on Top , its BYO wine too so that cuts down the price ... there were four of us , we had a two course meal -LRB- heaps of dishes ! -RRB- and coffee , with corkage on two bottles of wine and a tip we only spent $ 30 each !
