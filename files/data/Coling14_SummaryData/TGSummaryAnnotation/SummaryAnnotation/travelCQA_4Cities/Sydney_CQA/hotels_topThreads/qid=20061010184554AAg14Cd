I will be in ENTITY_Sydney in November for the ENTITY_Kylie_Minogue concert and I 'm looking for a nice hotel that 's not too backpackerish but also not too swish and easy on the budget . Around 3 to 4 stars will do .

If you are at the Entertainment Centre and want to be a step away it . There is the following ENTITY_Aaron_Hotel_Pensione_Hotel_Pacific_International These are very close and I think Pensione is cheapest . As for the ENTITY_Acer_Arena , that is in the ENTITY_Homebush Olympic Park and you can choose to live in either ENTITY_Parramatta or the ENTITY_City . The hotels I mentioned above are also a hope away from Central Station where you can hop on a train to Olympic Park which is about a 25 mins train ride . Hope you have fun at the concert !

It is called ENTITY_Base_Backpackers and it is a new type of backpacker place that is luxury -LRB- so do n't think in your head that it is like the dingy places you usually think of ! -RRB- . You can go in a dorm or you can book a single/twin/double room . http://www.basebackpackers.com/sydney It is conveniently located in the CBD , so you are close to The Entertainment Centre - 477 Kent Street . Range from $ 30 for dorm to $ 80 for a room . Another great place is Y Hotel . It is right by ENTITY_Hyde_Park , so still only waking distance to the concert - 5-11 Wentworth Avenue . Only about $ 70 .
