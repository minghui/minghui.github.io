Trains in/out of the airport are at extortion prices though !!

Worst case is international both legs . Allow an hour to get through customs and immigration -LRB- and will you have a visa ? -RRB- . Check in 2 to 3 hours before ongoing flight . That gives you a couple of hours , which gives you time to catch a train into the city tyo spend an hour or so there . Best case ids both legs domestic . If you do not have to re-check your bags you can be on a train in 15 minutes . You will have to check back in 30 minutes , so you will have 4 or 5 hours . The CBD is about 15 minutes by train from the airport and there is a station at Circular Quay , right on the ENTITY_Harbour with easy access to the Bridge and the ENTITY_Opera_House . Or just take a ferry ride .

Probably enough time to dash in and have a quick look at the ENTITY_Opera_House and the ENTITY_Harbor_Bridge , and then back to the airport . But at least you 'll have seen 2 of the country 's / worlds most famous landmarks . Go back again when you have a bit more time cos its a great city !

Then add either walking or ferry -LRB- which is the best way to see the harbour -RRB- to that and you would possibly have time . But if it is an International flight and you need to go back through customs I would not suggest it . But when you get there , maybe ask someone who works there what the go is and if it is at all possible .
