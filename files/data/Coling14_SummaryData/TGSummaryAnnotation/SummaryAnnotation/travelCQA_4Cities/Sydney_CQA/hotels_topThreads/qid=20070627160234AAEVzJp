The rooms are apartment style , good view of the circular qay and the harbour bridge . The place is finished in Marble , and yes , spa in some rooms . Follow the link and look for quay grand . Sebel manly by the same company is also okay . I used to work in the kitchen , so I also know the food is good . But remember , Sepetember is VERY busy due to the ENTITY_APEC summit .
