There are some 10 families Australia wide with one thing in common - a child with an extremely rare genetic condition. We would like to get together in a common area and have chosen Sydney as the location. The two people organising the holiday don't live in the Sydney area. We have tried looking at the various search engines for suitable accommodation but have had some problems with what it has found. What we are looking for: Budget/cheap (<$100 per day) accommodation. Cabin style or at least large enough for a family (average number or people would be 2 adults and 2-3 children, one of which with the disability). Some would prefer wheel chair access. Also if possible a kitchenette. As there will be "normal" siblings also present we would like to have them suitably entertained during the time we are there - so activities either at the location or around the area, We do not want to go too far away from the CBD in but also not too close as it has the cost factor. As we are flying in, we are cogniscent of the transport (hire vehicle or public transport). As you can see it is a difficult task, we do have time on our hands but because everybody is flying in to Sydney we are keen to book this by August. We plan to be there in March 2012. (one of the families is coming from NZ!) I am looking for you kind people that would know of a place that may be suitable or have been somewhere that you feel may be suitable. Either post here or you can email me directly (preferably) at michaelyoni@yahoo.com.au. Thankyou Michael Yoni Perth, WA.

I use to work in serviced apartments in Sydney which is now closed down. We use to have 1brm and 2brm apartment which we were budget and a 2brm started at $150 and that was for a 1month stay. A daily rate was $190 and we were the cheapest( mostly the reason why it closed down!!) The only place i would recommend that has apartment set up for families/disabilties facilities is Hyde Park Plaza Sydney. Its centrally located with walking distance to the supermarket, banks, resturants and 10min walk to the city centre. Its right on hyde park. Other than this you can look at waldorf apartments. But with all these apartments there is defintely nothing for $100. Good luck and hope you find something in your price range.

It has attractions of its own - beach, restaurants, cafes, small theatre and is on a train line. It is close to the Royal National Park (beaches, bushland) and not an impossible distance from the CBD.

There is cabin rentals in nice Cronulla which is only about half an hour away on the train, which is cheaper than taxis etc. http://www.cronullacabins.com.au/ There is also this site where you can find places to rent per night in Sydney: http://www.rent-a-home.com.au/accommodatâ€?Hope that helps a little!
