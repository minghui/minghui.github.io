Pick you up at the door and drop you back to your hotel etc. . Cheap too around 50-60 bucks all inclusive for the trip there and back -- you pay your own meals , enrty fees for skyride etc at the Mountain site . Nowhere in the ENTITY_Mountains is cheap mate -- its solely set up for the tour scene so you pay accordingly -- expensive.There are backpacker joints in ENTITY_Katoomba tho , dunno what they run at but if you do a day trip from the city , you really can fit in all the sites on the day excluding the need for an overniter . Have fun , its nice up there but even this time of year , take a warm jacket . It can get blimmin cold real quick there .

You can catch an intercity train with ENTITY_Cityrail from just about anywhere in ENTITY_Sydney to ENTITY_Katoomba . It takes a while to get there , but if you catch an early train you should be able to fit in everything you want to see . Driving might be a bit faster . You can catch a bus from ENTITY_Katoomba station down to echo point , where you can take the 999 steps , the scenic skyway and railway , take in the panoramic view or visit the Three sisters rock formations . I would recommend staying in ENTITY_Sydney and travelling up there for cheaper accommodation rates .

You can see all of the main tourist attractions in a day for sure . The cheapest way would probably be to book a tour . Public transit to get out to the mountains is costly , plus a lot of the sights are pretty spaced apart . I 'd recommend the company `` OzTrek , '' it 's $ 55 which appeared to be much cheaper than most tours . It 's family run , and the bus driver/tour guide was great . They pick you up right at your accomodation and drop you off there as well . You can also pay like $ 8 extra to take a catamaran back down the river into ENTITY_Sydney - if that 's where you 're staying .
