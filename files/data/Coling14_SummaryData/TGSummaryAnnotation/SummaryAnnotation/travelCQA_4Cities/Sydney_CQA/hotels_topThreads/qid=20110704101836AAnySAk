We want to be: - Near the coast - 40 minutes from Sydney centre (ideally with a good train link too but not essential) - We have 475,000 AUD to spend on a modest 2 bedroom house - Somewhere with a nice community Is this possible for our budget? We will travel to meet with estate agents soon and I'd like to be able to have my own suggestions.

One of the person said Merryland, true you can get a house for that price, but unless you want to live in a full blown Muslim community with Lebanese shooting at each other every month I recommend you stay away from that suburb and South West. Think you should try Penrith. Its an hour on the train to CBD, and one of the few stations where you can get a seat on the train in the morning to city before people start jamming up. Its also the major urban centre and high growth area as part of the NSW government's urban planning strategy. Cheap to live and good for family. Good luck!

Either direction is on a train link but you'd be looking at around an hour or so train travel time. You might be able to get something in that price range but it will be in an area away from the actual coast line and you'd probably have to drive to the train station to catch a train to the city. In Sydney area, you'd have to go away from the coast ie western suburbs. Not all suburbs are on a train line so you might be stuck having to drive to a train station also. I think you'd find better value down Wollongong area if you don't mind the train travel time. Consider a villa or a townhouse, these are like houses but don't have the same land size ie the backyard is more of a courtyard type arrangement and the buildings are quite close together.

Merrylands is 40 minutes from the city and you can get a house within your budget, but it's nowhere near the coast and it's a fairly basic area. If you were to consider an apartment your options increase a little. Edit: the north shore as mentioned above is a lovely area (I grew up there) but it's a minimum of $800K for a house.
