There is a good train service to Sydney from there but you are going to have problems if you don't have a car. You can manage without a car easily in the city as everything is close at hand and there are plenty of trains and buses to get around. This is not the case out of the city. There are trains and buses that are convenient for some things but not others. You will need to plan shopping etc around bus timetables if there are suitable buses. Where you choose to live will depend on the location of bus stops and train stations. If you have to walk two kilometres from the bus with your weekly shopping you will soon appreciate the convenience of a car. The closer you are to the beach, the more expensive it is. The central coast is more affordable than Sydney but not by much. Nightlife out of the cities is dominated by the big clubs.

Friends that have a holiday home at The Entrance said it's quite affordable, and their home was three minutes walk from the beach. I also noticed a lot of apartments not far from their Surf Life Saving building, for rent when I was there. If I was going to take up residence, I would have considered viewing. I took note that the shopping center was very accessible on foot, even at night there was entertainment to be found.

The train service to Sydney is excellent, pretty affordable housing and some superb beaches. The weather is a bonus and the lifestyle is brill!!
