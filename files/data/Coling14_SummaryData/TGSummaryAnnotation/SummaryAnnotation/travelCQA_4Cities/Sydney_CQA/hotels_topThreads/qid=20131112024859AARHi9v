But what really inspired me the first time, was the supper cruise with John Cadman, then it was the Explorer 2000, not sure what they have now. But to Cruise the harbor at night, and see all those lights, to see the Opera house lit up at night as well as the bridge, was awesome. You also had all those big homes that back on to the water, unbelievable. I go on a supper cruise every time I go back, you also have the Summit Restaurant at the top of Australia Square, and you have the other restaurant at top of Centre Point that you can view the city as it rotates.

But if you are looking for some places from where you can get a great night view of the city, try these 1. You can try out the BridgeClimb - this is a climb on to the Harbour bridge. The night walk costs around $200 and takes around 3-4 hours but is really worth the experience. 2. Another place where you can see the night view is the Sydney Tower eye. I think it costs $20 or so (sorry, don't remember) but it is a fantastic place to see the entire CBD area, including the Opera House, the bridge, etc. from atop. I would also recommend the day time trip because it was great.

You have three options. There is the viewing deck - straight up in the lift and then walk round - and two restaurants. One restaurant has a fixed price menu with various selections for each course, the other is à la carte and more expensive. Both are revolving restaurants so you get the magnificent view while eating dinner. The hills in the Sydney suburbs are not particularly high and views are blocked by buildings and trees. You might find a good view occasionally but Sydney Tower will give you the best view. One hill that does give a reasonably good view of the harbour and lots of lights at night is Observatory Hill at the southern end of the Harbour Bridge. Go up to the top of the hill and walk around. You can see Darling Harbour, the inner west and much of the north shore.
