Im moving to Sydney next week and I had a unit lined up and ready to sign and then the realestate tell me there is no car space and the place is no longer suitable. I start work on Monday 12th July so I have just one week to find somewhere to live so Im guessing it will be a hotel for a while. Does anyone know any cheap but nice hotels around the city that have car parking?

You can get it for about $140 a night. The hotel isn't overly fancy or anything, but I think it is about 4 or 4.5 stars. It's not to far from the centre of the city either.
