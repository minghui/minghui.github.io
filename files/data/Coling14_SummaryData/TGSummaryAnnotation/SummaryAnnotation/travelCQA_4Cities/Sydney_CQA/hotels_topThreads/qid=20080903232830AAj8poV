And safe people who do n't know the area claim its crime ridden but the facts from the ENTITY_Bureau_of_Crime statistics show that other suggested areas Manly , ENTITY_Cronulla etc have much higher rates for crime especially assault

I live in the ENTITY_Eastern_Suburbs , in ENTITY_Clovelly . Any suburb around that area would be great for you . Where I live , it takes me 1/2 hour by bus to get to the CBD -LRB- because of traffic -RRB- , 15 minutes to ENTITY_Bondi_Junction and 10 minutes to ENTITY_Randwick_Junction , all which are big for shops . There are also little shops every couple of street , like convenience stores , pretty much wherever you go in the Eastern suburbs . There are a lot of buses in the area , so transport is n't a problem , and if you get to ENTITY_Bondi Junction or the CBD then you can easily get a train , both places are easy to get to by bus . There are 2 gyms in ENTITY_Bondi_Junction , 3 between there and my house and too many to count in the rest of the area . There are pools in the area , the main one for me is at the uni and is very cheap , but you are also very close to a lot of beaches , all of which have their own outdoor pools . The crime rate is good , I do n't know much about that but it is a safe area to live . For running , there are a couple of big parks . I would suggest ENTITY_Queens_Park , ENTITY_Waverley_Park or , the biggest , Centennial park . I hope you find what you are looking for . the one downside of my area is it is quite expensive . It can be hard to find cheap aaccommodationand , because most of the area is so rich , the shops are more expensive too . But it is truly a beautiful place to live .

Its a train ride away from the CBD and has heaps of major shopping areas near by -LRB- chatswood etc. -RRB- , gyms are all over the place -LRB- literally , you 'd be able to find one in all of the suburbs mentioned -RRB- , low crime rates , surrounded by beautiful national parks -LRB- kuringai national park is gorgeous -RRB- and also some lovely gardens , also only about a 30 min drive to the northern beaches -LRB- avalon , bilgola etc. -RRB- Hope this helps , if the north shore is n't to your liking there are areas further up the train line that are closer to the CBD ... newtown , wollstencraft etc. st. leonards and artarmon are about half way between the two , but north shore has better national park/bush lands -RRB- good luck ! : -RRB-
