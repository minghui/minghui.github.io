I went by bicycle , so it took me a bit longer than it would take to drive it , but it 'll make a good day trip if driving . Definitely worth a visit , because of the quiet country roads , the sunday market at ENTITY_Windsor , scenic views of the ENTITY_Hawkesbury_river , yummy devonshire tea at the historical Ebenezer church and a relaxing meal at the Wiseman Ferry pub . If you want a quiet night away from the city , there are some good places to stay overnight in the area , as well as the camping grounds being reasonably priced . Other good options are the South coast -LRB- ENTITY_Royal_National_Park , ENTITY_Wollongong , ENTITY_Kiama_&_Berry -RRB- , the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains & the central coast -LRB- The entrance has alot to do there -RRB-

ENTITY_South_of_Sydney i liked ENTITY_Royal_National_Park , and further south i would recommend ENTITY_Jervis_Bay . North of ENTITY_Sydney , you can take a day trip to Ku-ring-gai National Park , further away , maybe ENTITY_Gosford area . I really liked ENTITY_Hunter_Valley , ENTITY_Byron_Bay and places around ENTITY_Port_Macquarie but they 're a bit further than a day trip .
