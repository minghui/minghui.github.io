qid=1006052803175_answer_1	1	qid=1006052803175	2006-05-30 06:48:05 +0000	best_answer	 The best location would be at -LRB- or close to -RRB- Circular Quay . Here you are right near the harbour so will have easy access to ferries -LRB- to Manly and ENTITY_Taronga Zoo -RRB- and other boats which explore the harbour ; you 're at the end of the CBD but not right in it and very close to shops/cafes/restaurants etc ; transport at your doorstep -LRB- trains and buses , which will take you wherever you want to go -RRB- ; right next to the Rocks where you will find galleries , weekend markets , restaurants etc ; within easy walking distance to the ENTITY_Opera_House , Botanical Gardens , and museums ... I could go on and on , but I 'll just add that you and your family will love spending time around Circular Quay . I worked there for many years and never tired of the spectacular view of the harbour , it is just mesmerising , and it is also a very safe area as there are always people around . As far as hotels go there are many to choose from , from 5 star to less luxurious options . I would suggest maybe trying Rydges -LRB- on Grosvener St I think ? -RRB- for your price range ... great hotel but not a budget blower .

I 've stayed there a number of times and it 's a really good central location . Just do n't expect it to be a luxury place cause it 's not .

They have a large place near Central Station ; easy access to ENTITY_Sydney city and the train lines to go elsewhere . My daughter and I frequently use YHA when travelling throughout ENTITY_Australia -LRB- along with camping -RRB- as they are usually cheap , clean , convenient , friendly .

I know a good hostel . Its called ENTITY_Railway_Square_Hostel and its a YHA . You can probably get family rooms and it will be cheaper than a hotel . If you pay a bit extra you can get a private room and it will still be cheaper than a hotel . Of course if you have little kids you might not want to stay in a hostel .
