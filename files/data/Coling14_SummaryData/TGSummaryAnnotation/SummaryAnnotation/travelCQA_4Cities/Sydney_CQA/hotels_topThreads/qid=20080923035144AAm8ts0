Suburbs inner city include ENTITY_Surry_Hills , ENTITY_Darlinghurst , ENTITY_Elizabeth_Bay , ENTITY_Potts Point , Pyrmont . Also popular are ENTITY_Bondi in the ENTITY_East and ENTITY_Newtown in the inner West - although you will need to probably get public transport - which is fine . Car spaces are like gold in the inner city and unless you are lucky enough to get one with your apartment some local councils give out parking permits to residents . It will depend on which local council area you end up living in . Good Luck !!!!!!!!!!!!

I would recommend living out further , even around ENTITY_Sutherland area , and catching the train to the city . But that depends what time you would be getting home of a night because I personally would n't want to catch a train home of a night . You would have to do some research on different areas for prices etc etc. . But I would recommend ENTITY_Sutherland shire if you are n't working late and could catch the train home in the afternoon . Good luck .

I was working in ENTITY_North_Sydney and I rented an unfurnished studio in ENTITY_Neutral_Bay for $ 240 a week . It was small , but had parking space and was a minutes walk from the ferry which took me right to the city . So , I 'd look around ENTITY_Milson 's Point , ENTITY_Kirribilli , ENTITY_North_Sydney , Neutral Bay if I were you ... You will find something . Look on www.domain.com.au and other websites with listings . Good luck !

Try ENTITY_Alexandria , ENTITY_Newtown , ENTITY_Surry_Hills for inner suburbs . If you are prepared to live out of ENTITY_Sydney a bit anywhere along the trainline to ENTITY_Sutherland should be more reasonable . The internet site to start looking is http://www.ljhooker.com.au/ Its very reputable and at the high end but if you can afford what they offer you can shop around and do a bit better . Inner south and southern suburbs are your best bets . ENTITY_Lane_Cove in the north is a good commuter suburb but a bit pricier ! Good luck have fun !
