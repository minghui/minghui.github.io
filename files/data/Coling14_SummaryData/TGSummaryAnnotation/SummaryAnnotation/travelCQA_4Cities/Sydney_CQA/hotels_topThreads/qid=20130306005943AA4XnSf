We do n't have many 2 bedroom houses , our style is mainly 3 or more bedrooms when it comes to houses . You 'll need to look west of ENTITY_parramatta to get anything 2 bed for around $ 380 a week . Furnished or semi furnished is also not common to find . Mostly rental properties are empty , you bring your own beds , furniture , fridge , washing machine etc. . You would also need around $ 500 a month for food , private health insurance is around $ 200 a month , bills like electricity , gas etc about $ 200 month . Transportation by train to the city weekly would be around $ 50 a person . Living in ENTITY_Sydney is expensive .

That will get you an apartment within 20km of the city in the `` not so good '' suburbs - but only unfurnished . Furnished accommodation in ENTITY_Sydney is only found at either the high end $ 1500 a week accommodation , or the low end - where tey rent by the hour -LRB- i.e. a doss house -RRB- . People do not rent out accommodation here with furniture . So you will need to purchase that here . $ 400-450 a week is low end near the city -LRB- where most 2-3 bedrooms apartments are $ 500 and houses $ 650 a week -RRB- , so do not expect much at all . Most houses are 3-4 bedrooms , 2 bedroom houses are rare , usually older and hence more expensive . For food/groceries expect to pay $ 150 + a week minimum . Public transport - $ 61 a week . Medical expenses , if you need medical insurance that is around $ 150 a month for a family -LRB- if you are eligible - on a PR -RRB- .

ENTITY_Sydney is a very very expensive city to live in
