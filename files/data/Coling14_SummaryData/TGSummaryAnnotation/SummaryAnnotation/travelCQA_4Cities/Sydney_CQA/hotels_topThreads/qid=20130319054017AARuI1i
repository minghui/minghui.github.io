I am moving to ENTITY_Sydney next month on . I am an Indian would prefer a clean and safe place to live in alone .

If , and that is a big `` IF '' you find any sort of accommodation your wil be paying through the nose . When I was transferred over there , the apartment I was supposed to be staying at was n't ready . I ended up getting a short term six months lease , at Hurlstone Park/Dulwich ENTITY_Hill , close to transport , shopping and other amenities , and a lot less than being in the city . My apartment I was allocated was on the northern beaches , and we were paying in the order of $ 125.00 less at Hurlstone Park . So you need to consider this .

You need to live in one of the surrounding residential suburbs , close to a train line . ENTITY_Clarence_St can be walked to from Town Hall or Wynyard train station . To rent a 2 bedroom apartment in a `` reasonable '' area -LRB- inner west , outer west or south -RRB- will cost you around $ 450 a week . Houses on the north side tend to be more expensive and houses on the east side -LRB- near the beaches -RRB- are expensive and also mostly serviced by buses not trains for transport . Trains are generally quicker for transport . The Further away from the City , the cheaper -LRB- less travel time means higher rents , -RRB- Most areas in ENTITY_Sydney are safe . You could get a studio -LRB- no actually separate bedroom , just one large room -RRB- or 1 bed apartment but 5 visitors are n't going to fit or be allowed to stay for 1 month -LRB- fire and safety regulations -RRB- . Your family could stay in a serviced apartment -LRB- short term rental -RRB- but these are expensive .

It is all high rise , business buildings , with some very , very expensive apartments . May I respectfully suggest that you might be better off living a little way out of the city , near a train line , where you can commute to ENTITY_Clarence st easily each day . You can rent a house or larger apartment in the ENTITY_Granville , ENTITY_Lidcombe , ENTITY_Auburn , ENTITY_Parramatta , ENTITY_Granville area for much less than the price of a studio apartment in the city . It will be safer for your family too . There are a lot of Indian people living in ENTITY_Harris_Park , which is between ENTITY_Granville and ENTITY_Parramatta . It 's a nice area , despite the general prejudice of ENTITY_Sydney people towards the western suburbs . I live in the ENTITY_Granville area , and its easy to get from ENTITY_Granville station to the city . Same with ENTITY_Lidcombe . I 'm an elderly person , and it 's quite safe , and I have good neighbours here . ENTITY_Google_Harris_Park , ENTITY_Granville , ENTITY_Lidcombe and see what you think . Make sure you are near a train station . ENTITY_Google Domain.com for ENTITY_Australia , and loot at what 's available for more accurate prices .

EDIT ENTITY_CMC -- You would have got a lease because you are Canadian and an official . I am NOT being in any way derogatory or racist here but no ENTITY_Sydney landlord is going to lease anything to a temporary migrant Indian bloke who wants to bring out his whole family to stay a while . Also , I reckon you would pee your pants to see the rents asked for in ENTITY_Husrlstone_Park / . ENTITY_Dulwich_Hill these days . Those may be old and run down terraces yes , but being a hop , skip and jump from the CBD , they are commanding huge rental returns .

ENTITY_australia is a safe country ... BUT ... !!!
