Traveling time to the city or anywhere else would take at least 30 minutes , so it would sum up to an hour of traveling to the city and going back to the airport . Which leaves you with just an hour or less to do some sightseeing . If you really want not to miss your flight then I would suggest you to bring a few good books to read while waiting for your flight . If you really want to take that less than an hour sightseeing , check out the Airport Link website for the station locations in the city . The Airport Link is the fastest way to go . Another suggestion is go shopping at the duty free shop at the airport . But what I would really suggest to you is get a sumptuous meal at a restaurant nearby . There are already 2 restaurants at the airport and also other restaurants near the Airport .

The weather is fantastic and it will be great to get out of the air conditioning of planes and airports . Enjoy your brief time in ENTITY_Sydney

You need to clear immigration and customs to leave the airport , which can take up to 45 minutes if it 's busy . Then the train is the quickest way into the city , but you need to change trains at Central Station to get to Circular Quay -LRB- ENTITY_Opera_House , ENTITY_Harbour_Bridge etc. -RRB- so this trip can take over 30 minutes to do in one direction , providing the trains are running on time . -LRB- And ENTITY_Cityrail is famous for it 's delays as well -RRB- Then you still need to be back at the airport to check in for your next flight 2 hours before departure , so it doesnt leave you much time to spare . Sadly , there also isnt anything to see near the airport either . It 's an ugly industrial area .

My suggestion would be to catch it to Circular Quay . From there you can see many things including , the ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge , The ENTITY_Opera_House , catch a ENTITY_Sydney Ferry to ENTITY_Taronga Zoo , dine at many fine restaurants . More in the centre of the city -LRB- Town Hall station -RRB- you can go up ENTITY_Sydney Tower for a birds eye view . Basically 2-3 hours will be gone in a flash , there is so much to do . Enjoy !
