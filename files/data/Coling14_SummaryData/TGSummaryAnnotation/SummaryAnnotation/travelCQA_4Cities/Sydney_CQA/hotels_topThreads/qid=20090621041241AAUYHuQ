Here's some costs to consider, when planning your trip. The cheapest way to travel from Canberra to Sydney would be by using the Greyhound buses. At the moment there is a special going on 1 way tickets at only $15 each. http://www.greyhound.com.au/Bookings/speâ€?Also had a quick search of all the backpackers in Sydney, that I know are in the inner city. And for a single room they most average $100 per night. YHA Railway Square http://www.yha.com.au/hostels/details.cfâ€?hostelid=215&CFID=5346387&CFTOKEN=8637â€?YHA Sydney Central http://www.yha.com.au/hostels/details.cfâ€?Wakeup (near central station) http://www.wakeup.com.au/rooms-twin.html And there's Sydney backpackers http://www.sydneybackpackers.com/Room%20â€?(This one's a bit cheaper at only $69 for a single bedroom) It's not likely that any budget hotels in the CBD will be cheaper than those options. So, be prepared to share a dorm room in a backpackers. What to do when you are here? Go for a walk around the city & do some sightseeing. For example - The Rocks, Sydney harbour bridge (Climb the south pylon stairs for a good view of the harbour), the opera house, the Royal botanical gardens, the Art gallery of NSW, Hyde Park, Pitt St Mall, Paddy's market, Darling Harbour, etc Or get the ferry from circular quay over to Manly & check out the beach and the harbour views at North Head. Taronga Zoo is a fun place to visit & it's only a short ferry/bus trip away from the city. Is there a theme park (with rides) in Sydney? - There's only Luna Park. It's okay but it's nothing compared to the big theme parks you can visit on the Gold coast. I'm hoping this info is a good starting point.

I am not sure about backpackers, but if you are able to find some for under $50, you may be fine. You can look for backpacker places in notorious Kings Cross, and around Central station. There is no theme park in Sydney, but Luna Park is good. You can find its information here www.lunaparksydney.com As for recommended places, it depends more on your taste, there are plenty of places that you can find out from some tourist office and choose what you want to see. If you can, increase your budget to atleast $500 and you'll have a comfortable trip. Good luck and have fun.
