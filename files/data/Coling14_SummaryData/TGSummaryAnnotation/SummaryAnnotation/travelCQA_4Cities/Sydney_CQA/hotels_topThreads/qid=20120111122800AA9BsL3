My husband and I live here but funnily enough spend weekends in the city occasionally... We've stayed at the Radisson Plaza Resort in a 1 bedroom suite and it was great, you can also pay not too much extra to join the executive club for dinner/snacks/canapes drinks etc, sooo worth it because you spend less when you go out afterwards. The restaurant Bistro Fax was slightly above average. Also stayed at Quay Grand Suites, Harbour View Suite and loved it. It overlooks Circular Quay ferry terminal and is central to Circular Quay/Rocks area. The last place we stayed at was the Quay West, the only decent rooms are above the 20th floor facing the Harbour. Everything else feels like you are in the middle of a city and not very nice. It's in the Rocks area and lots of bars/shops nearby. If you want to go for New Years Eve you have to book well in advance, pay extra, and stay usually minimum of 3 nights but some places request 5 nights! But if you can afford it, sooo worth it.

All hotels in that area are extremely expensive. I would consider staying just a little away from the CBD, somewhere near Central Station at the Country Comfort or somewhere like that if you are on a tight budget. There are a quite a few slightly less expensive around that area - Broadway, Paddy's Market area. That way you can either a) walk to the CBD or b) hop on a train from Central. Both are reasonable. Sydney hotels are booked out for months before New Year, so make sure you allow for that and book in good time.
