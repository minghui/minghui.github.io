Gold coast is beautiful scenery but ENTITY_Sydney is a spectacular city . the opera house and botanical gardens , the rocks , crossing the harbor bridge , shopping , etc. just got back from ENTITY_Sydney and it is just lovely ! You 're in for a treat either way . Enjoy !

ENTITY_Dreamworld , ENTITY_Seaworld , ENTITY_Warner_Bros_Movie_World , Wet n Wild , Dracula 's Restaurant -LRB- i think that 's what it 's called -RRB- , the Casino , the beaches , Surfers Paradise , not to mention all the smaller attractions as well .
