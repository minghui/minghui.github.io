I 'll be staying in the heart of the city so anything that is easy to get to by public transport will be great . Like what are the best shopping malls , good cheap city restaurant , etc. . . Thanks !

You could visit the ENTITY_Australian_Museum or Powerhouse Museum . There is also the ENTITY_Art_Gallery_of_NSW . Jump on a train out to ENTITY_Katoomba for a day trip to the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains , or you can book a tour leaving the city itself . Catch a train or ferry to ENTITY_Parramatta for a different shopping experience , ENTITY_Australia 's largest shopping centre is there ... which is not much compared to the ENTITY_US e.t.c. Hope a train to ENTITY_Cabramatta for some cheap and good ENTITY_South_East_Asian food , jump a bus to ENTITY_Leichardt for a touch of ENTITY_Italy , visit ENTITY_Newtown for a range of food and shopping .

If you 're feeling brave , you can do a ENTITY_Harbour_Bridge walk , though I think it may be a little pricey . You must , though , go to the ENTITY_Harbour_Bridge tourist place in one of the pillars of the bridge : you can climb up stairs inside to a lookout and there 's lots of information about the history of the bridge . I 'd also recommend a ferry ride ; maybe out to Manly for a meal -LRB- fish and chips ? -RRB-

The best way to experience the harbour is by exploring it on a dinner cruise . Board the ENTITY_Sydney Showboat for a unique dinner cruise experience .

ENTITY_Westfields at ENTITY_Bondi_Junction is very close the heart of the city ... just jump on a train . It 's my favourite shopping center . Also check out the ENTITY_Centerpoint_Tower .
