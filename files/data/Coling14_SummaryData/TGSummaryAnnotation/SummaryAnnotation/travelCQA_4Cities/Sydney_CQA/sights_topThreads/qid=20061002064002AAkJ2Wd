qid=20061002064002AAkJ2Wd_answer_7	2	qid=20061002064002AAkJ2Wd	2006-10-03 12:14:05 +0000	answer	 The rocks is the birthplace of ENTITY_European_Australia . As a result there are some interesting places to have a wander about . It is nestled under the Southern end of the ENTITY_Harbour bridge -LRB- city side -RRB- and as a result is quite contrasting . You will find quait terrace streest dwarfed by the bridge , which I like . From there easy access to circular quay for ferries on the harbour , a walk across the harbour bridge , which is great . You can also climb up the ENTITY_Southern_Pylon of the bridge for a small fee ... if you do n't have the funds to do the bridge tour , which is ecessivly expensive . There are also a lot of old , original ENTITY_Sydney pubs which add to the atmosphere . Do n't get trapped in the touristy bits though . They are a little lame ... they are generally found along the end of ENTITY_George_Street . So yes , interesting history , interesting architecture , fantastic views and access to the rest of ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour . Definitly a place worth visiting ... from there walk around the harbour front , around the ENTITY_Opera_House and then on through the Botanical Gardens . All very nice

For the Rocks market on Saturday . If you have time and are interested climb the hill and visit the Observatory . All this is apart from the ENTITY_Opera_House and the Botanical gardens . -LRB- see other answer -RRB- Oh and when in the rocks take a couple of hours and go on the Manly ferry -LRB- return of course -RRB- - its the cheapest way to see so much of ENTITY_Sydney harbour.The ENTITY_Old_Bank opposite the Police station is a good place to eat .
