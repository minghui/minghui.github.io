Orchestral concerts were given in its Town Hall , and staging opera was almost impossible due to the lack of suitable stages . The appointment of Sir ENTITY_Eugene_Goosens to the posts of Chief Conductor of the ENTITY_Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Director of the ENTITY_NSW_Conservatorium_of_Music in 1947 brought into ENTITY_Sydney 's musical life a focal point for the need to create a better venue for the performing arts . Upon accepting his position , ENTITY_Goosens told reporters that his plans included the creation of a concert hall suitable for opera as well as orchestral performances . The idea was hardly revolutionary ; indeed the post-war ENTITY_Labour government had given lip service to the concept as part of its reconstruction and redevelopment programs . However , apart from occasional public announcements and exhortation from ENTITY_Goosens , nothing happened for seven more years . Finally , late in 1954 , the State Government of ENTITY_New_South_Wales , finding itself increasingly embarrassed by its own inaction , became involved in a moderately supportive manner . The Premier of the day , ENTITY_Joseph_Cahill , was enthusiastic about the idea and it was he who set up the committee which got the project under way . He also set up an appeal fund to raise money for the building . When it became obvious that the fund would not even raise the $ 7 million the ENTITY_Opera_House was first estimated to cost , ENTITY_Mr_Cahill introduced the ENTITY_Opera_House_Lotteries . The original appeal fund raised about $ 900,000 and the rest of the $ 102 million that the ENTITY_Opera_House ended up costing came from the profits of the lottery . The building was completely paid for by July 1975 .
