Stage I -LRB- 1959â€ 963 -RRB- consisted of building the upper podium . Stage II -LRB- 1963â€ 967 -RRB- saw the construction of the outer shells . Stage III consisted of the interior design and construction -LRB- 1967â€ 3 -RRB- . Stage I commenced on December 5 , 1958 , by the construction firm ENTITY_Civil_&_Civic . The ENTITY_Opera_House was formally opened by Queen ENTITY_Elizabeth_II , in her capacity as Queen of ENTITY_Australia , on October 20 , 1973 . From building commencement in December 1958 to opening in October 1973 . Nearly 25 years . Huh a quarter of a decade . We do things slow here , but we do them well .

While the ENTITY_Opera_House was being built Australians bought tickets in ` The Opera House Lottery ' . I 'm guessing this contributed to the building of the ENTITY_Opera_House . The ENTITY_Opera_House sits on Bennelong Point -LRB- ENTITY_Bennelong - he was an Aboriginal Man -RRB- on ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour . ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour - one of the most beautiful places in the world . If you ever come to ENTITY_Sydney buy a ticket for a ferry ride across the ENTITY_Harbour . It 's a cheap price for a priceless view of the ENTITY_Opera_House and the ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge . Do n't wait 30 years to see it .

First , it 's spelt ENTITY_SYDNEY , and it does n't have a bay , it has a harbour - ENTITY_Darling_Harbour , where the ENTITY_Opera_House is . Yes I 've heard the same thing , taking 30 years to build .
