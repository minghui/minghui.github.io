They limit the number of people going there so get in very early . Food and drink -LRB- and toilets -RRB- are all available on the night and is pretty family friendly . To exit the city afterwards , catch the train from ENTITY_St_James_Station -LRB- under ENTITY_Hyde Park near ENTITY_St_Marys_Cathedral -RRB- back to Central and the make your way home from there to avoid the crowds . Blues point and ENTITY_Milsons point are ok . But Milsons point will have you practically under the harbour bridge itself . Great for a first hand view but not great if you want to see the lights on the bridge itself from a decent distance . Keep a wide berth of circular quay and the opera house . These areas are totally crushed with people and circular quay station will likely be closed . You definitely will want to avoid the area if you have young kids .
