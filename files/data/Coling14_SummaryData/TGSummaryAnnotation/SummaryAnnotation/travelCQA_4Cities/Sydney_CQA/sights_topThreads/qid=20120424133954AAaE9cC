The main serttlement was around the ENTITY_Tank_Stream and Garden Cove , roughly the area from Circular Quay to the Botanic Gardens and back up ENTITY_George_Street . There was a rocky promontory that led down to ENTITY_Dawes Point which was effectively ignored by the town planners . There were caves and ledges in the rocks and it was in this area that huts and shanties were built by some free settlers , ticket of leave convicts , sailors who jumped ship etc. . The area became known as The Rocks . A road was cut through the ridge for ENTITY_Argyle_Street and you can still see the convict pick parks in Argyle Cut today . Over the next hundred years , the Rocks became the centre of crime and vice in the colony and occupied the area west of ENTITY_George_Street up to the top of the ridge where the new Observatory was built . In the early 20th century , plague arrived in ENTITY_Australia and swept through The Rocks as well as areas near Circular Quay and through ENTITY_Redfern to ENTITY_Newtown . Most of the shanties and huts in the area were demolished in a big urban clean up . Houses had already been built in parts of the Rocks and in Millers Point on the other side of the ridge . More houses were built but the Rocks as was then known was effectively destroyed with the building of the ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge . The Rocks today is the area west from ENTITY_George_Street up the hill to the Observatory . The other side of the hill with the ENTITY_Garrison_Chrch and the Lord ENTITY_Nelson and ENTITY_Hero_of_Waterloo_Hotels is Millers Point but those are usually included in The Rocks by most people .

It is bordered by Circular Quay , ENTITY_Dawes_Point , the ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge -LRB- and approach ramps -RRB- and city circle railway line . It rises from ENTITY_Circular_Quay sloping up to Observatory hill . The original landscape was a rocky hillside full of caves and outcrops , which is how it got its name . It is amongst the oldest places in ENTITY_Australia to have been built by the first European settlers . It is popular with tourists for its fine museums , art galleries , handcrafts and its weekend markets . It is popular with city workers and sydneysiders as a refuge from the rest of the bustling city . Some of the buildings are over 200 years old . There were a couple of blocks of homes destroyed in order to build the ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour bridge , but most of the suburb remains intact . During the 1970s developers wanted to level the entire area and turn it into skyscrapers . This led famously to a public outcry against it . The residents protested . The major builders union -LRB- the BLF -RRB- placed `` Green Bans '' over the entire area and saved it from destruction . All this action finally resulted in The Rocks becoming the first heritage listed area in ENTITY_Australia . Before it was saved , The Rocks was run down and had a reputation for having high crime and being a haven for poverty . Since then it has turned around completely the other way . Its quaint little town houses are now highly sought after . As you noticed many boutique hotels were built . Old warehouses were refitted as apartment buildings and the entire suburb found a new lease of life . It has never looked back since .

It is a great little area , and on a weekend , they used to have an open street market , not sure if they still have it . It 's also a stone throws away from the Ferry Wharves and Circular Quay .
