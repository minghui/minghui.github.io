HOWEVER the ENTITY_sydney harbour bridge is a master peice at night during New Years eve . You can look up the ENTITY_NYE firework display on you tube . You can also walk above through the arches of the ENTITY_sydney_Harbour bridge and see most of ENTITY_sydney landscape during the day .

The view is spectacular . I have a fear of heights so have n't been , but the photos look amazing and my friends who have done have raved about it . You can walk for free across the bridge on the level of the cars and still get a view . For the top tour , you end up in a grey jumpsuit , tethered to your fellow tourists and the bridge as you climb to the summit . This can be done at dawn , day or twilight . The upside of this over a free walk over is that you get a better vantage point for both sides of the harbour . You can only walk across the opera house side of the bridge for free . That said , the tour is not exactly cheap . Check out the official site . The official website is below

Climbing the ENTITY_Sydney_Harbour_Bridge is by a staircase in the middle of the bridges arch . It 's quite strenuous hence the need for safety harnesses incase you slip , blood alcohol testing is done via the breath test to make sure your sober for the climb too . You can walk across the bridge along side the high way but it 's all caged in and very noisy . Take the climb ... i think it 's around $ 100 - $ 200 AUD per person when i was invited to climb . The view is spectacular :--RRB- Because the CBD of ENTITY_Sydney is so small and everythings compacted you see the CBD , Royal Botanic Gardens , ENTITY_Navy_Base , ENTITY_Opera_House_&_Lunar_Park all at once :--RRB- The night view from ENTITY_Potts_Point or even ENTITY_Wooloomooloo_Wharf of the Bridge & Opera house are beautiful ... but i 'm biased as i live here ! hehe
