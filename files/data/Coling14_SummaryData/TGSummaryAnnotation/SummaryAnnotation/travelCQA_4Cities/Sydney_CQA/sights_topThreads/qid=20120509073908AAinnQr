It supposedly represents the idea that ENTITY_Australia is also a place of culture and has an opera house . ENTITY_Sydney is also home to ENTITY_Opera_Australia , which is ENTITY_Australia 's ONLY truly full time opera company -LRB- a bit like The Met in ENTITY_New_York -RRB- . The ` sails ' of the opera house are a bit like waves really , so I guess it also represents that the sea is an important part of ENTITY_sydney and the ENTITY_Australian lifestyle . I suppose you could suggest it maybe represents the idea that people from many places came across the sea to settle in ENTITY_Australia . Why do n't you ENTITY_google_Sydney_Opera_House , and learn more about the architect , see what he had in mind when he designed it ?

It is easy to recognize , you have seen it in countless films , and it is possibly more famous than the nation/city it self
