First off you have to buy the "Passbook" don't recall the name but you'll find it through any travel agency or you can purchase them at the Harbor. The Harbor is the place it all happens. Plan your day(s) around the passbook schedule. Here are the things my bride and I did. Take a harbor cruise to the Sydney Toranga Zoo you'll see all the country's animals. Tour the Opera house if there is a concert try see it. Tour "The Rocks", if you are at the harbor it's too the left, this is the oldest part of Sydney. There are a number of places in the Rocks to visit. Make sure, if you are up to it to do the bridge climb, this is a real treat. The locals call it the "Coat Hanger", for good reason. There is a museum on one on the pillars close to the rocks that explain the bridge and harbor. There is a monorail in town you have to ride it once. Take a harbor cruise toward the entrance to Sydney Harbor you will see a lot of the area. There are harbor ferries that run all over the place take one to the Aquarium you'll be impressed with the shark tank and Maritime Museum just across the waterway. Walk up to the Observatory on observatory hill. There are two "Ghost Tours" if you have two nights, you must make reservations in advance take one or both. There is a lot of history in and around the Rocks. Shopping, you will not fall short of shopping. There is even an F.W. Woolworth's store. You'll find plenty of information around town on things to do. You will not be bored. The Blue Mountains, this time of year, but they are fantastic to say the least. You can't go wrong with a tour to the Blue Mountains. Hope all this helps. Enjoy....
