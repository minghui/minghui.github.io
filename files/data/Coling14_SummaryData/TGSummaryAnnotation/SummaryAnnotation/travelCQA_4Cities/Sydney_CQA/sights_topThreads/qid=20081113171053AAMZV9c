As much as the idea of seeing in the New Year by the Bridge seems wonderful, as a family with young/teenage children whose family from the UK is visiting I don't really want to have to sit in one place for the whole day in order to do so...so, my question is does anyone have any other ideas for a family group staying near Parramatta to see in the New Year which will be memorable especially for the Poms. Thank you!

You should investigate a quieter place, and take a picnic. It's not a like a concert where your view of the stage might be blocked - the fireworks will be clearly visible in many areas. Ask around about these areas. I live in Glebe, for example, and we can see the bridge and harbour from the glebe foreshore. This is a huge park area, ideal for picnics, and ball games to keep the kids occupied. Parking shouldn't be a problem either.

Your best bet would be to get to a harbourside park - round the Rose Bay/Watsons Bay area is good. Still really crowded, but not full of drunken idiots like the Quay.
