Me and my mum are going to Sydney in the new year. We aren't into 'adventure activities', like bridge walking or dolphin tours, or Opera house visits, we have been there before and like: Shopping, art galleries, markets, beaches So to the people who live there and are wise, what are some cool places to go? Some galleries, vintage shops etc! Much appreciated xx

For shopping, hop on the train to Newtown and have a look through all sorts of off beat shops, fashion and otherwise, there.

In Manly you have the opportunity to swim at a harbour beach or in the ocean. Manly also has a good night life and is a ferry ride into the City. around from Circular Quay is the rocks.For old stuff this place rocks. There are various markets around, I think it is Liechardt that has a saturday markets or there is Paddys. China Town is a great place to get a meal.
