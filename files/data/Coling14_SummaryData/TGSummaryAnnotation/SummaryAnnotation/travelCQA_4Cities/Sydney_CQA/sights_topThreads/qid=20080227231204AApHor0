From there you can walk to Chinatown, Paddys Market and the Fish Market Hyde Park Barracks- History of the convicts For shopping and architecture go to the beautful QV building. Also the Strand Arcade next to Myer. Walk around Hyde Park Gardens and visit Oxford street(Gay Area) Sydney Museum and then walk over to Wooloollomoo where Russell Crowe lives - Cafes and restaurants along the waterfront Take the 324 bus from Circular Quay to Double Bay, a lovely little place known as Double Bay, Double Pay as there are expensive shops there. Sit with a coffee and watch the world go by or sit down by the harbour. Take the Sydney Explorer bus which will take you through all the little bays to Bondi For another great craft market go to Paddington on a Saturday morning. Call in at the custom house to see a model of Sydney For great 360 views of Sydney go up the AMP Tower. Just a few ideas. Have a great time
