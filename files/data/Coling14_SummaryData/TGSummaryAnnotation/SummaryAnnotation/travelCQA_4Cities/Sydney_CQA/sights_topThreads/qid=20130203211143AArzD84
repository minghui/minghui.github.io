Seven CityRail stations exist in the CBD , with Circular Quay being closest to the ENTITY_Opera_House , both located in the northern parts of the CBD which extends southwardly to Central Station . Walking from the ENTITY_Opera_House to the Central Plaza would take about 25 minutes -LRB- about 2km -RRB- . The best public transport option is to walk for about 7 minutes to Circular Quay interchange where you can catch bus route 301 , 302 , 303 , 309 or 310 that should take you to the intersection of ENTITY_Castlereagh_St and Market St which is about 4 minutes walking to the Central Plaza .

If you stay on the train through central and get off at Circular Quay station you will have the ENTITY_Opera_House in view with a short walk to get there . From Circular Quay take a train to Town Hall Station . Use the underground shopping mall at the northern turnstiles of the station to get to the Queen ENTITY_Victoria_Building . From the QVB you can then get to ENTITY_Pitt St mall , the major department stores and ENTITY_Sydney_Tower at ENTITY_Centrepoint . I would suggest you just get an all day ticket from the airport -LRB- make sure you include the return trip to the airport -RRB- . It will cost a bit , but then you can hop on and off the city circle line as you like . If you end up stuck at central station , then use platforms 16 and 17 to get back into the city circle . Use platform 23 to get to the Airport .

Or you can cath the train at Circular Quay -LRB- which is nearest to the ENTITY_Opera_House -RRB- , and get off at Town Hall for the shops . The train from the airport comes into Central and I believe Town Hall . Check if it goes to Circular Quay , I think it would have to . It 's only about a ten min ride to the city from the airport on the train .
