I found if I get out of the CBD , and out to the suburbs , like a suburb called ENTITY_Cabramatta , a heavy ENTITY_Asian influence , smell , feel and touch the influences . Head out to a place called ENTITY_Parklea , where there is Parklea Markets , interact with the traders . Or head out to ENTITY_Camden , I the country of the city , I went into a cafe come restaurant called ENTITY_Creme_'_Della_Creme ' , before I went to a local winery , I actually bought a case of a Brand called ENTITY_Mama_Port and shipped here to ENTITY_Canada . I caught the 324 bus from Circular Quay , and went to ENTITY_Watsons_Bay , sat on the edge of the wharf there , and watched a couple of old codgers cast a line in , or going to the converted pub there called Doyals for a seafood meal with a glass of wine . Walk up ENTITY_Williams_Street , and head towards ENTITY_Kings_Cross , on the left , we found an Italian Restaurant , down stairs in a basement set up that looked like a grotto , amazing atmosphere . You have the area around ENTITY_Sussex , ENTITY_Dixon and hay Streets , known as ENTITY_China_Town , some bargains down there . ENTITY_LJ , you only have to look a little further than the CBD , and there is a whole new experience . I have n't even mentioned areas of the ENTITY_South_Coast like ENTITY_Kiama . or the ENTITY_Central_Coast like The Entrance , ENTITY_Avoca and ENTITY_Terrigal . By asking the locals about places to go to , ENTITY_Sydney and surrounds opened to me .
