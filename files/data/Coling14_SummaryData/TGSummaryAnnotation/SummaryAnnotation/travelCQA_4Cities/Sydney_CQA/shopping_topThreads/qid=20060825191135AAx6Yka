Along the waterfront, there are an array of excellent restaurants ranging from char grill to seafood. Near the opera house there is the opera bar, with a live band, so if you are interested in a show and dinner, that would be the place to go. Also near the Opera house is the Oyster bar, a romantic little cottage by the waterfront. They have mostly outside seating, so if it is a cold night, the Oyster bar is a no. There is a great range of Asian restaurants as well. In the city, closer to accommodation, lots of great bars, clubs and restauants are only a short walk away. Sydney is an excellent city with great food, and there are few risky places. Enjoy!
