So , I am planning on going to ENTITY_Sydney , ENTITY_Australia in the summer -LRB- ENTITY_U , S summer , ENTITY_Sydney 's winter -RRB- . I know we have opposite weather . So can someone tell me how is the weather in ENTITY_Sydney like , during their winter ? Is it worth going during that time of the year ?
qid=20091102195408AAKIkeU_answer_1	1	qid=20091102195408AAKIkeU	2009-11-03 05:00:03 +0000	best_answer	 ENTITY_Sydney tends to have a mild climate . Which means it does n't get very hot or very cold . The coldest in winter is around 3-5 degrees with the occassional night going down to 0 or -2 in the west of ENTITY_Sydney . But sometimes in the middle of winter it can be warm enough to be wearing t-shirts . So you probably want to pack a range of clothes to take with you . If you are travelling you will probably find yourself outside for longer than you would normally be , so it is a good idea to take clothers that are warmer than you would normally wear for that type of weather . Also sometimes ENTITY_Sydney can have quite wet winters , so be aware of that as well . In addition you might want to get out of ENTITY_Sydney and head off into the blue mountains an hour west of the city centre . Up there it can be quite cold at night and warm during the day . But if you are lucky the weather should be mild and pleasant , not too cold .

It will be cold and most likely raining during June at least . If you want to enjoy the Australian weather then Winter probably is n't the best time to visit ENTITY_Sydney . Temp will be around 16 degrees on average . Spring or Autumn are much better times of year to come . It is n't so hot . The only good thing about Winter is there wo n't be so many tourists and it will be cheaper as it is low season .

You may not go swimming but other than that all the sights are there and it is cheaper at that time of year . At the airport in ENTITY_Sydney go to the Hotel Desk and ask for a Bed and Breakfast where you want to be . They are nice and far cheaper than hotels . The Desk will also tell you the cheapest way to get to the bed and breakfast . Take a harbor ferry around the bay !
