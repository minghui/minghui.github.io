The city is great for bargains and you are coming in June so there are plenty of mid year sales. I like to shop at Oxford street in Paddington. I always find bargains there.

Go to Pitt Street Mall, the Queen Victoria Building, or any westfields around Sydney suburbs like Parramatta or Chatswood. Markets are cheap like Bondi Markets on Sundays or Glebe Markets on Saturdays, Paddington Markets and The Rocks markets are good but for a market they are a little pricey.
