ENTITY_Castlereigh_St - High end stuff like D&G , ENTITY_Gucci and a whole bunch of other crap high end stuff too - when you go to pitt st mall these places are paralell to the pitt st mall . -LSB- close to pitt st mall -RSB- World Square - 1 or 2 year old building -LSB- brand new complex -RSB- , it 's on ENTITY_George st just down from the cinemas and close to ENTITY_china town . ENTITY_Oxford_St - Gay people 's stuff . Some pretty good fashion though . ENTITY_Paddington - High end classy stuff which is overly priced in a seriously bad way . about a 5 minute or 10 minute cab ride from the city centre . ENTITY_Westfield_Bondi_Junction - Make this a day trip the place is friggin HUGE . Get a bus , train or a cab , bus or train is cheapest . ACCOMODATION = There is about 1000 different places to stay , i would check out a wevsite like www.roamfree.com.au , or some other kind of accom site for ENTITY_sydney , just type in ENTITY_google .

Queen ENTITY_Victoria_Building and ENTITY_Pitt_St mall , world square and the strand are also good ideas to check out . if your want to go to a shopping centre try bondi junction . . another cool place to go is manly and you can take the ferry there are some good areas there to shop . . and centre point tower has some shops but im not sure of its quality ... for fun also check out circular quay and darling harbour this should be a good mix of all brands and also prices . . hotel wise try looking up the york apartment , ENTITY_somerset darling harbour apartments , shangri-la -LRB- probably the most expensive -RRB- obviously the hilton . try looking up www.stayz.com.au have a good trip

Sorry can not recommend you a hotels as I have no idea of pricing , but if you want a nice area , check hotels in ENTITY_Bondi and Manly beaches . Have a good trip !

You should check out the shopping around the Rocks -LRB- even though it 's a bit touristy -RRB- , definitely go to ENTITY_Pitt_St_Mall in the city centre and the surrounding arcades and malls , and ENTITY_Bondi_Junction_Westfield - a huge centre with many designer brands as well as chain stores . You might also enjoy walking up ENTITY_George_St. , from ENTITY_Railway_Square -LRB- Central Station -RRB- towards the city . There are a lot more Asian-owned stores and cheaper brands . http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&hl=enâ€?I would recommend staying in the city itself ; the Rocks , Railway Square and ENTITY_Pitt_St are within a fair walking distance . The easiest way to get to ENTITY_Bondi_Junction is by train from Central , Town Hall or Martin Place stations . -LRB- The other city stations do n't have trains that go directly to ENTITY_Bondi_Junction -RRB- . http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&hl=enâ€?
