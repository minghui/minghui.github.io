Definitely to the blue mountains to sit in the cool cafes , look at the scenery , and maybe buy some hippy clothes -LRB- take the train to ENTITY_Katoomba -RRB- . If they are more sporty you can do some hiking . Take them for the city tour , ENTITY_Hyde park , ENTITY_Art_Gallery_of_NSW , ENTITY_Royal_Botanical_Gardens , ENTITY_Opera_House , Circular Quay and the Rocks . Take them to oxford street in ENTITY_Darlinghurst or King street in ENTITY_newtown for drinks , clubbing and boys -LRB- no clubbing the boys , well they are Aussies , they like a bit of being clubbed , so go ahead -RRB- . Shopping , well most people from ENTITY_Miama would want Rip Curl , ENTITY_Mambo and Billabong gear , which you can buy at surf shops at ENTITY_Bondi_Beach or ENTITY_Manly_Beach . Take them to one of these beaches , and if you have time go to either coogee beach or head up north to ENTITY_Avalon or ENTITY_Palm_Beach . Also the rocks market , paddies market and Glebe market -LRB- among many others -RRB- on weekends . And of course the ENTITY_QVB . Shopping in ENTITY_Australia though does n't stack up against the ENTITY_US .

Also plenty of great cafes for lunch and / or coffee . 2 : Catch the ferry to Manly , go and get an ice cream at ENTITY_Ben and ENTITY_Jerry 's enjoy the beach -LRB- weather permitting -RRB- for a couple of hours then catch the ferry back to the city . Make sure you have your camera ready on the return trip as you will be able to get some spectacular photos of the city . 3 : Hang out in the city for the day , window shop in the Queen ENTITY_Victoria_Building -LRB- especially the antique jewellery stores and ENTITY_Nelson_Leong 's store . . hideously expensive but hey . . a girl can daydream right ? -RRB- . Grab some sandwiches for lunch and eat them in ENTITY_Hyde_Park . 4 : Go down to the Rocks , the birthplace of ENTITY_Sydney , lots of cool little shops tucked away there , a little touristy but still good . Go late afternoon , have some dinner then go and do a ghost tour . LOTS of fun . http://www.ghosttours.com.au/ 5 : Do something touristy today , for example , a ENTITY_Bridgeclimb , ENTITY_Taronga_Zoo , the Aquarium , ENTITY_Sydney tower ... the list is endless . 6 : Get out of the city today , do a day trip to ENTITY_Katoomba , make sure you go on the scenic railway , check out the antique stores in ENTITY_Katoombas main street -LRB- if you are in to that sort of thing -RRB- but the scenic railway is a MUST . 7 : Last day -LRB- Phew -RRB- Go to ENTITY_Yum_Cha for lunch , catch the train to ENTITY_Bondi_Junction and check out the huge ENTITY_Westfield shopping center . Then go home and figure out how you are going to get all the stuff you have bought home : -RRB-
