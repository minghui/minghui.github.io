I 'm moving to ENTITY_Sydney to go to University ! -LRB- I 'm from ENTITY_Canada -RRB- There 's an ikea close by so that 's where I 'll get my furniture -LRB- They 're unfurnished , it 's just a condo complex for students -RRB- but I 'm looking for stores like bed bath and beyond or places that sell housewares for collage students . You know of any ? I want to get most of it online before hand so it 'll be at my place once I 'm there .

Much cheaper and surprisingly good 2nd hand furniture . Maybe a new mattress , but the rest can be bought for a fraction of the cost of ENTITY_Ikea . Same with tableware , cooking utensils etc and check out towels and other linen too . I understand hoe nice it is to have new stuff , but I am assuming you are on a limited budget and what are you going to do with any furniture and household goods when you go home ? You can either donate it back or re sell , but the 2nd hand stuff will sell better and more quickly as it would be less expensive . It is expensive to live in ENTITY_Australia and unless you have unlimited funds it might be a better idea than new furniture . However if you want to spend the money then it might be an idea to tell us which university ? ENTITY_Sydney is a huge city .

You must be a bloody unique one then as here all students are crying poor . Students usually frequent 2nd hand stores and at best ENTITY_K-Mart . I have a real suspicion no one has told you that against the dearest ENTITY_Department_Store in ENTITY_Canada , ENTITY_Sydney is REALLY expensive . I think you be in for a bit of a shock at our prices here which if you do n't already know then you better prepare yourself for a few eye openers . This ai n't ENTITY_Canada Im afraid .

Unless you win the lottery , you wo n't be able to afford ENTITY_IKEA or Bed Bath and Beyond . ENTITY_Kmart is going to become your new best friend . And you wo n't be able to order it online and have it waiting at the apartment ; someone would need to be there to accept the delivery and they 're not gon na like it if it 's not you .
