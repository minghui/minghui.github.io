Lots of original art and design . Including red gum furniture -LRB- I love it -RRB- , paintings and so on . Also head up to the blue mountains 1 hour + by train from central station . Get off at ENTITY_Katoomba and wander around the shops and cafes there -LRB- and also do some bush walking -RRB- . Plenty of orginal art work in that area too . ENTITY_Aboriginal art is a bit over ratted . In the ENTITY_US it has been popular for some time , but in ENTITY_Australia it is considered a little kitch . If you do get out into an aboriginal community and get some original work made in the ENTITY_bush , then I would say go for it . For some original art works by up and coming artists try ENTITY_Newtown , and less now , ENTITY_Glebe point road . For the house there is n't really special brands , a lot of ENTITY_US friends stock up on billabong and ENTITY_Mambo brand clothes . You could by an akubra hat along with a Dry-z-bones coat and a stock whip -LRB- different from a ENTITY_US bull whip -RRB- to hang on your wall .

Here is some information on fake and authentic didgeridoos : http://www.ididj.com.au/ You could buy some roo poo to display in your house -LRB- not sure it could really be classed as a decorative piece though !! -RRB- http://www.roopooco.com/prd_roo.htm Souvenir shops in places like The Rocks in ENTITY_Sydney will charge you the most ridiculous prices â€ so be careful you donâ€™t get ripped off . Opals are beautiful , as are pearls from ENTITY_Broome , but very expensive . Maybe buy an Australian scenery print and frame it when you get home : http://www.emmascottage.com.au/artGallerâ€?http://www.kenduncan.com/ http://www.sydneymate.com/gift-store/picâ€?http://www.donestore.com/products.asp?caâ€? .

Any tourist area will have expensive , putatively quality made in ENTITY_Australia souveneirs . Typical stuff includes boomerangs . A digeridoo is a unique easy to use instrument that can serve as a large space-saving decoration when the novelty wears off . ENTITY_Sydney has dozens of picturesque beaches & cliff walks . It would take you a few weeks just to see them all , the most famous probably being at ENTITY_Bondi and Manly .
