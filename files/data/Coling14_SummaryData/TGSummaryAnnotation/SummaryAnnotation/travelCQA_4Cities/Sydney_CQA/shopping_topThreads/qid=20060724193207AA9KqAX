Why bother travelling if you 're not going to see anything ? Anyway ... to answer your question ... Just go to ENTITY_Bondi . There are lots of hostels there and lots of other English/Irish/Scottish people there too so you 'll never have to meet any real Australians or actually see any of ENTITY_Australia . Bring whatever clothes you like . In ENTITY_Bondi you 'll have a bed , a bar and a beach . Perfect . All you 'll need for a holiday . Worldwide travel ... it really broadens the mind , does n't it ??? Have a good trip .

Are you planning on spending your entire time in ENTITY_Sydney ? If you want a cheap place to stay with heaps to do . . come up to ENTITY_Cairns . You can get a flight from ENTITY_Sydney to Cairns for about $ 100 . Backpacker/hostel type accomodation is very cheap in ENTITY_Cairns . A nice place such as ENTITY_Gilligan 's in ENTITY_Cairns is about $ 20/per person for a night for a clean room that you can share with four other people and share a bathroom . Its right in town , bar and club downstair . I found this website that will give you an idea of prices all over ENTITY_Australia and the world . Come up to Cairns ... you will love it !!! As far as packing ... September can still be cold but it will be warming up by October and November is the start of summer so pack for summer I would say but maybe some jeans and light outerwear ... Hope you love your holiday in ENTITY_Australia !

Check out the back packers packing list and it will give you an idea . You do n't want to carry more than 25 lbs . Any where in ENTITY_Sydney is fine to stay . People are good , also go to manley Au , the beach is the best .

It is OK to pack light but do a good job of mix and match so that you do n't always look the same . Even if the people around you do n't get bored , YOU will get bored if you do n't have some variety in clothing . Of course , you can always buy some things . And while you are packing light , do n't forget to pack a good travel medical policy . Go to http://www.wavehelp.com/travel-medical/iâ€?and click on the little red phone booth to read about `` Worldwide Health '' insurance from ENTITY_TravelGuard , the industry leaders . You can buy on-line if you want to . ENTITY_Best wishes .

September can still be a bit cool , you need jeans and a jumper . ENTITY_BTW , ENTITY_Cairns is awful ! only go there to get out of there and go to port douglas - the BETS place in ENTITY_Australia - have fun
