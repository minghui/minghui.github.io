Me and my best girlfriend are taking a trip to ENTITY_australia in may of 2008 , and it is between 2 hotels right now . The Grace hotel and the swissotel . Which one is better ??

The Wissotel is infinitely better and the location is probably a little better . May is generally sunny days with an average temperature of about 75 degrees F , with cooler weather at night . Your fashion is probably a little ahead of ours , so wear what you normally would wear in the ENTITY_US and you 'll be ok . Your hotel reception should be able to suggest good nightclubs and bars ; there 's tons of them and it really depends on what you 're looking for . `` Hemmesphere '' is a hip place to go but make sure you look the part as it 's very trendy . Check out ENTITY_Oxford_Street , renowned for its food and nightclubs . It 's where they hold the Gay Mardi Gras each year , so do n't be surprised if half the people you see are the not the gender you think . ENTITY_Kings_Cross is a well known for its buzz at night , but is a seedier side of town and is notorious for strip clubs and brothels , bright lights and sordid behaviour . Double Bay is the ritziest shopping area and is just a short distance the CBD . I hope I helped a little . Enjoy your hol !

If you want to stay in a hotel where there is entertainment at night , you could look at ENTITY_Woolloomooloo , ENTITY_Darlinghurst , ENTITY_Surry_Hills , ENTITY_Kings_Cross or Potts Point . All five areas are very close to the city centre but have plenty of interesting and good cafes and bars . May is when the cold weather starts setting in but you need to know that cold weather in ENTITY_Sydney is nothing compared to cold weather in ENTITY_Europe or ENTITY_North_America . The average day temperature will be about 18C . So , bring t-shirts , but also bring a sweater or two and a jacket . If you want good advice on day trips or bars or where to hang out while you are in ENTITY_Sydney , try this website : www.cityhobo.com The website will also give you plenty of information on the five suburbs I suggested as an alternative to staying in the city . One of the best things about ENTITY_Sydney is its beautiful harbour . I think it is really important that you do some day trips along the harbour . One of the best is a walk from ENTITY_Taronga Zoo to ENTITY_Balmoral_Beach . About halfway between the two is a stunning cafe called Ripples . Very few Sydneysiders know about it . But the food there is good and the views are amazing !!!!! Good luck and enjoy ENTITY_Sydney . It 's a great city .

It has a very busy Irish Bar and is 10 minutes from Circular Quay and less to ENTITY_Darling_Harbour . It might be a bit old fashioned for two young girls . Weather in May 60-65 F so think Spring -LRB- Although it is Autumn -RRB- for clothes . Fun Bars and night clubs , do not worry you will find them . Great city .

I like the character of Swissotel better , but both are viewable through the website . You choose . There are lots of bars and fun places depending on your style . If you are adventurous , you could do the red light district King 's ENTITY_Cross , or the bars around ENTITY_Darlinghurst . The saner bars are in th Rocks area , or in the uppity northern suburbs .
