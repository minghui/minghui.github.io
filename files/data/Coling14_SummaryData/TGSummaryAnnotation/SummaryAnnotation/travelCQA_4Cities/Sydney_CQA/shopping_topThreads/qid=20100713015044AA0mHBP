So my friend wanted to take me to paddington markets but my mum says that considering I don't know the area at all, it just wouldn't be safe. Are there any other markets in sydney that are fairly safer and just as good as paddington? We wanted to go shopping. So please don't say paddy''s markets. Oh, and if they ran on Saturday, that would be great! Thankssss.

Another one is the Rocks markets. open on Satudays, no problems there either. The outer suburb markets, tend to have the same old stuff , nothing in comparison to the city markets.

On any given market day all markets have a large number of people grouped in a small area. If you have your wits about you then you wont have any problems. If you are looking for something similar to Paddington markets then I would say Glebe Markets, The Rocks Markets, Fringe Bar Markets (in the Fringe Bar just down the road from Paddington Markets) or maybe even Bondi Markets though I haven't been to that one so I cant really comment.
