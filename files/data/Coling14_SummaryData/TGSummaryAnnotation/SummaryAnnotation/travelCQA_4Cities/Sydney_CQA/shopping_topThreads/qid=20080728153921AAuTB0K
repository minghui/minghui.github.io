What about food and other supplies ? Here you can go to Dollar store or ENTITY_Walmart , everything is so cheap . Does ENTITY_Sydney have ENTITY_Walmart or Dollar storelike store chains and prices are relatively low?I know they have ENTITY_K-mart , how are the prices ? How much is a gallon of milk ? Here at ENTITY_Sams you can buy a dozen of bananas for $ 2.00 ? How much a dozen of bananas in ENTITY_Sydney .

It is more of a ` no frills ' type of supermarket with cheaper prices compared to the major chains . The packaging , storage and staff are kept to a minimum with you requiring to being your own bags or paying a fee for one . ENTITY_K-Mart is not a supermarket . It is a discount department store like BIG W . We also have ' 2 Dollar Shops ' or variety stores which sell cheap and unusable GARBAGE imported from God knows where . They also have forged versions of real items which annoy the hell out of me .

If you 're asking about grocery stores with lower prices , we have ENTITY_aldi . . But you have to bring your own shopping bags , because those cost extra :-RRB- ENTITY_Kmart isnt that cheap . . and doesnt sell groceries . Its a department store ... We do have dollar stores , like golo and the reject shop , which sells alot of things at cheaper prices ... But it might not be like the ones in ENTITY_america ... We sell milk by the liter , instead of gallon . The prices of milk are different , depends on what brand . Its around $ 4 for 3 liters of milk , thats how much i buy it for anyway . We have whole milk , skim milk , soy milk . . We dont have those 2 % etc milk . . Bananas are sold by the kilo . Here in ENTITY_Sydney you can get bananas for around $ 1 - $ 2 a kilo .

Our minimum adult wage for permanent workers is $ 14.31 per hour plus benefits and our adult casual minimum is $ 17.17 per hour . We also have universal health care and better social security than in the ENTITY_US . Because wages are different , it 's pointless trying to compare the cost of grocery items on a $ for $ basis . Some things will cost fewer $ $ and others will cost more , but we have far less real poverty than in the ENTITY_US and nearly everyone enjoys a good standard of living .

The ENTITY_US does sound cheaper but it would depend on what wages were like to know if stuff really does cost less . We have ` two buck ' stores where you can buy some nasty cheap imported rubbish : - -RRB-

However , go to the wrong shops and you can pay double or more !
