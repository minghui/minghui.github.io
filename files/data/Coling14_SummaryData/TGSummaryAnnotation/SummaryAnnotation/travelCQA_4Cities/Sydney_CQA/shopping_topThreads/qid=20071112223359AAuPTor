Buy the land and you can build whatever you want but again you are unlikely to build a two-bedroomed house as the banks wo n't support them - there is no demand for them if the house is to be resold . If I wanted to live in a brand new two bedroomed house I would not be looking anywhere near ENTITY_Sydney .

I guess you have to ask yourself what 's more important : the house or the area you choose to live in ? If you want a brand new house you will probably need to move to the outer suburbs but the prices of property in many of those places have been falling , and just today there was a story in the news saying the prices in those areas will continue to fall . You also have to work out how much money you have to spend . It 's not an easy question to answer . If I were you , I 'd try and work out where you wanted to live and then take it from there .
