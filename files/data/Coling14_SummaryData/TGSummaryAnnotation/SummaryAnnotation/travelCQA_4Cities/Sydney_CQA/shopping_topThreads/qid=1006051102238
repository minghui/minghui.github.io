A friend is going to work in ENTITY_Sydney and needs to buy or rent a place . Does n't know if she 'll be there two years or ten ? Will she stay forever ? Should she buy ? Or , should she rent ? And still plan to come back .

ENTITY_Sydne got such a multicultural community here Bying a property is too easy if you have a full time job and 10 % deposit money in bank but it is very expensive in ENTITY_sydney now a days also various types of rates like a kind of tax apply and interest rate also increase minimum twice in a year I had a teacher who sell his house and start living in a boat and use public transport to come to uni So it 's better to rent a place Rent start from 180AUD per week to 1200Aud per week depend 's on where you live . The best thing is let her come over here and try to find a place near her work place or somewhere she can catch public transport . In ENTITY_sydney some places you have to travel by train ferry and bus so it 's better to live nearby In my life I have seen very few peoplle go back their own country unless ENTITY_DIMIA or ENTITY_AFP kick them out Rather than that I found most of the migrant bring their whole battalion here in ENTITY_sydney . Anyway wish you best of luck

Some places are nicer than others . ENTITY_Sydney is probably one of the more expensive places to stay . it is possible your friend may not be able to afford to buy a place , or even stay long depending on what type of job she has . Some freinds of mine stay in a cheaper apartment in woolomoloo and it is $ 520 per week in rent .

ENTITY_Sydney is a lovely place but also a big city with some traffic at rush hours from the suburbs to the city centre so depending on where she works , I would suggest to look for a nearby apartment . Many families live in houses but they also have very chic in-town accomodations ; depends on the life style as well . Difficult to say much but I can suggest below web page for more ideas ... http://www.expatfocus.com/expatriate-australia Good luck !
