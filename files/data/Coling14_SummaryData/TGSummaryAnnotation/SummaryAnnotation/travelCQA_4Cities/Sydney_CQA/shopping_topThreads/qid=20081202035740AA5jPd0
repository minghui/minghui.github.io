You have to see the harbour bridge , opera house , go to luna park , go to manly or just wander around . Also be sure to catch a ferry on the harbour - it 's great , especially on a fine day .

Or you can go to ENTITY_Jay_Jays . . they have some cheap clothes there as well . . When you get to ENTITY_sydney just look for a ENTITY_westfield shopping centre/mall . .

There you will find many shops that are n't too expensive -LRB- some may be , others will not be -RRB- but in general most the stores in ENTITY_westfield are pretty affordable
qid=20081202035740AA5jPd0_answer_7	2	qid=20081202035740AA5jPd0	2008-12-04 05:17:16 +0000	answer	 ENTITY_Sydney -LRB- or ENTITY_Australia in general -RRB- is not that great for clothes shopping . We have 20 million people over a country the size of the ENTITY_US , so there just is n't the market for the variety of clothes that you would get elsewhere . The others have listed plenty of places ... but definitely get the ferry across the harbour . The Manly ferry is best .
