We went by train to ENTITY_Blacktown , then the bus to Parklea Markets . Name brand jeans , for $ 20.00 , Tshirts I picked up 3 for $ 2.00 , I priced a leather jacket , at one of the Westfields shopping complexes would have cost me $ 2.40.00 , at Parklea Markets , genuine leather , $ 75.00 I think i paid and I still have it and wear it . What ENTITY_Tentofie mentioned about the outlets at ENTITY_Sydney 's Central or ENTITY_Surry_Hills area is right -LRB- thank you for reminding me Tentofie -RRB- . That area around Central is big for the rag trade area , and good deals can be found in those back street , factory outlets . Similar to our ENTITY_Chabanel_Street outlets here in ENTITY_Montreal . My wife found some great deals , and shipped a lot of clothes and suits back home here .

Try ` Revenge Fashion ' on ENTITY_George_Street to start with , ENTITY_Tel 2 9264 4400 , there are often bargains to be had there . ` ENTITY_Leesa ' in Piccadilly Place on ENTITY_Pitt_Street has locally made clothes at pretty decent prices . ENTITY_Westfield_Bondi Junction-the big shopping centre on Burwood has shops like ENTITY_SES , Supre and ENTITY_Bardot where you wo n't spend too many dollars .

And in spite of some of their stuff going downhill , I found some gorgeous heels and bikinis in ENTITY_Kmart the other day . There is absolutely nothing wrong with buying from either of those stores - and they 're cheap . There was a pair of shoes in ENTITY_Kmart that if I had any money whatsoever I 'd be buying - I normally do n't look good in heels but these made my legs look like they went for days - and they were $ 15 .

To find others , just ENTITY_Google `` factory seconds clothing sydney '' and follow some of the links . As has already been suggested , ENTITY_Paddy 's Market is well worth a look . Clothes there are often copies of expensive lines sold elsewhere .

Therefore not cheap ! Maybe the burwood mall which isnt too far from the cbd , here is the website http://www.westfield.com.au/burwood If you want super cheap , then honestly try paddy 's markets which is just in ENTITY_china_town . I bought a top from sports girl for $ 80 and then saw the EXACT same top at paddy 's market for $ 20 !!
