September , October , November are spring . September and the start of October are still a bit cold , so your warm clothes will still be good to wear . The end of October and in November , it starts to get quite warm . Light pants , shorts , t-shirts would be appropriate . December and January are Summer , it is very hot in summer in ENTITY_Sydney . Singlets and shorts would be appropriate .

For Winter , definitely bring warm clothes ! Preferably layers -LRB- depending on how you handle the cold , you might either want to wear more layers or less layers . . whichever it is , by wearing layers you will be able to adapt to either less or more -RRB- . I 've never worn gloves in ENTITY_sydney but I usually wear a scarf and boots . At night it gets particularly cold ! As for spring ... once it gets to the last months of the year it can become pretty damn hot ! Things like shorts , teeshirts and singlets are all great items . Do n't forget your swimwear ! ENTITY_Sydney has some spectacular beaches and can be soo packed during the summer .

For example , when I go to ENTITY_Sydney and I am in their winter , their winter is more milder than what I experience here in ENTITY_Canada , so I adjust to their standard . Spring in ENTITY_Sydney is a lot warmer than here , so if I had an idea , I may be better able to advise you , but I think you get the general picture .
