If you do n't mind the heat -LRB- +35 degrees -RRB- and want to party then come around december/january when all the uni holidays are on !!! the city is normally pumping on a thurs , fri and sat night !!! many foreigners go out in the city but if you want to get out and see the ` culture ' first hand then you have to get out of ENTITY_sydney ... try newcastle up north or head out west on the train to orange or ENTITY_dubbo . . they are close enough to ENTITY_sydney to go out to for a weekend and you will see the real aussie culture in these smaller cities ! Plus you will most likely be the only foreigner in town and this can have its advantages ; -RRB-

qid=20070508024721AAQ3aLA_answer_7	2	qid=20070508024721AAQ3aLA	2007-05-08 09:54:43 +0000	answer	 I live in ENTITY_Sydney If you want to swim on the beaches its a bit cold to swim in winter . If you do n't want to swim any time of the year is okay . ENTITY_Sydney gets down to about 8 degrees celcuis during winter which is cold for us but no too cold for people that are used to snow and waether colder during their winter . ENTITY_Sydney is fun in summer and the beaches are wonderful to swim at all up and down the coast . Between October and Februaury would be good for a swim . I hope you enjoy your time in this city of mine .
