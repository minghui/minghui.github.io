They usually get their stuff from the same place as you would in ENTITY_Albany or ENTITY_Buffalo_NY , they go to the shops and buy it . You get hair driers etc from a department store , your groceries and toiletries from a supermarket -LRB- unbelievable -RRB- , there are trains at the train stations , buses at the bus stops . ENTITY_Melbourne is much the same , -LRB- like ENTITY_London or Cleavland or ENTITY_Toronto or any other city -RRB- Seen one city , seen them all , basically ? What are you expecting exactly ? Kangaroos riding crocodiles down the main street ? As for which city is best-this is a hotly contested issue down there . ENTITY_Sydney - the weather is nicer and there 's some amazing stuff within a days drive . ENTITY_Melbourne is a bit wetter and colder in winter and hotter and drier in summer , but people who enjoy the theater and arts seem to prefer ENTITY_Melbourne . They 're much of a muchness I reckon . Move to ENTITY_Queensland !

ENTITY_Sydney is a vibrant city with spectacular landmarks including the ENTITY_Harbour and its ENTITY_Harbour bridge , the ENTITY_Opera_House , the historic Rocks area , Circular Quay , ENTITY_Darling_Harbour and popular ENTITY_Bondi_Beach - one of the many fabulous beaches . The Queen ENTITY_Victoria_Building was a purpose built shopping centre celebrating Queen ENTITY_Victoria 's Golden Jubilee . This site also helps you http://www.planbooktravel.com.au

Hair driers etc you can get in many places , but the main places would be the department stores such as Target , Big W , ENTITY_K-Mart , Myer , ENTITY_David_Jones . The main supermarkets are ENTITY_Coles and ENTITY_Woolworths , although there are a number of smaller chains and independents as well . It sort of sounds as though you think ENTITY_Sydney will be a small town , it has approximately the same population as ENTITY_Los_Angeles , and will take more than 2 hours to drive from one side to the other . The best place to live depends on what you would like , near your work is obviously a good place . It also depends on your budget . You might like to consider the eastern suburbs -LRB- eg ENTITY_Bondi_Junction , ENTITY_Coogee -RRB- , the lower north shore -LRB- eg Crows Nest , ENTITY_Neutral_Bay -RRB- , or the inner west -LRB- eg ENTITY_Petersham , ENTITY_Newtown -RRB- , as these areas are close to the city . This also makes them more expensive however . Or for a less expensive area perhaps live near ENTITY_Parramatta where there are lots of shops and restaurants you could work in . Public transport is quite comprehensive , there are buses , trains and ferries . Job sites are www.seek.com.au and www.careerone.com.au , but you are probably better just approaching busineses with your resume once you get here . ENTITY_Melbourne is also a good place - it 's a bit more arty/cultural/fashion oriented . Most people on a working holiday travel around , spending time in several different places . Why not spend time in both ? Oh , and are we twins or something ?
