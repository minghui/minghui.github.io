There are choices between serviced apartments, hostels and cheap 2 and 3 star hotels here: http://www.cheaperthanhotels.com.au/Austâ€?Some of the offers include a few free extras like breakfast and use of facilities, but you really need to make up your mind where in the City you want to stay. The beaches are only 30 mins away with buses, ferry or trains if it's for hols

I stayed at the De Vere hotel a couple of months ago which is a decent budget hotel. You should find a lot of choice on www.flightcentre.com.au too.

Formule 1 has rooms at around $60/$70 per night. The Formule 1 in Enfield has rooms for $69 per night and is in a good location if you will be driving (there's a bus stop across the road if you'll be relying on public transport). It's not that far from the city and Burwood Westfield.
