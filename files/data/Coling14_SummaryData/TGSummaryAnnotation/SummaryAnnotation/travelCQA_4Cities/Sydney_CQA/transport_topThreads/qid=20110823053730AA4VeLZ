Countrylink is the name used by the rail system in NSW for its country trains . There are buses that go to ENTITY_Canberra regularly . If you are not going to rent a flat in ENTITY_Canberra , where are you going to stay ? It is nearly 300km from ENTITY_Parramatta to ENTITY_Canberra and the bus or train will take at least four hours to get there and the same to get back . You have to stay somewhere in ENTITY_Canberra . As you are a student , share accommodation might be worth looking at . If you want to commute from ENTITY_Parramatta , the only real option would be to fly and that would still take at least two hours by the time you have caught the train to the airport , checked in , made the flight and caught a taxi from ENTITY_Canberra airport to the university .

Either rent an apartment or ask the University for information on student accommodation . ENTITY_Canberra is 300 kms from ENTITY_Sydney , and there is no way you can travel there on a daily basis . You will need to find accommodation and move there , either travelling by bus , train or plane .

There is the Country Link train between Central and ENTITY_Canberra Railway Station . There is also the ENTITY_Murrays Bus and other services between ENTITY_Parramatta and Civic -LRB- central ENTITY_Canberra -RRB- . Any of these services take several hours either way . As well , you would probably be looking at half an hour extra on an ACTION bus to get to the campus with longer for the train . This would be OK for a one-off trip but quite impractical on an ongoing basis . Regards
