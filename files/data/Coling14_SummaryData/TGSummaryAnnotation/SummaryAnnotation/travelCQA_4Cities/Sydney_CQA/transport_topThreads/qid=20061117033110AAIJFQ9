Rent varies alot, depending on which suburb youre in. If ure in the Eastern Suburbs, apartments can range well over $500/week. Travelling on buses and trains isnt too expensive. So, u dont have to worry about that. Here are some links you can look at: for rent: www.domain.com.au www.realestate.com.au (Note: for rent, just click on rent, and also make sure u know the differents suburbs of Sydney and type in. If u wanna know the different suburbs and areas, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney, and scroll down the bottom. It will show the different political areas and regions, and each one has the suburbs belonging to each individual area) for travel: www.sydneybuses.info - for buses www.cityrail.nsw.gov.au - for trains For food: www.virtualtourist.com, and then click on Sydney and there are different subsections, one of them should be restaurants. Youll get different reviews from all of Sydney and it shows the approx price tags and some links to the restaurants

Also where you want to work and how far you are prepared to travel to go to work. Sydney is a very big place. 50 Square kilometres. It takes 2 hours by car to cross Sydney from East to West. Public transport is pretty bad compared to other countries. The trains only service a third of Sydney and are slow. As for the buses, they are ever slower. A 2 bedroom apartment will varie between $250 and $500 a week depending on how far you live from the city centre. There is very little reason to live next to the city centre unless you intent to go out every night to enjoy the night life. Food... Eating at home for one person. You would be eating the very best food everyday with $150 per week. I reckon you can do it for less. Take away food. Around $15 per meal Good quality wine. Around $12 a bottle

Getting around is very expensive.... if you live downtown you could walk to work and all otherwise expect to pay $50 per week on transport. Food is also very expensive expect to spend about $100-$150 a week on food. To cover your basics food/rent/transport you would need at least $600 per week.
