The Rocks is the furthest distance in the Circular Quay area -LRB- ENTITY_Harbour , ENTITY_Opera_House etc -RRB- that you would need to walk to . Should take about an hour -LRB- about 2kms -RRB- . It should only take 1/2 hour by foot to the centre of the city . Bear in mind that the walk from ENTITY_Kings_Cross to anywhere in the City will be an interesting one , with plenty to see along the way ... and there are always trains or busses if your feet get sore ! Here is a link to the rail network : http://www.cityrail.nsw.gov.au/fares/triâ€?You can use the trip planner here to search `` Kings Cross Station '' to `` Circular quay station '' for information on how to get there using public transport . -LRB- Should only take about 15 mins -RRB- Dont forget to take a ferry ride to Manly and back again while you are here . ENTITY_Kings_Cross can be a little seedy at times , take a little care - the nightlife is fabulous . Have a great time !

There is much to see and beautiful vistas open up along the way . If you are going out for the day , starting with a walk to the city will be most enjoyable . Coming home it is uphill all the way . If you are tired after a day out , you do n't want to trudge up ENTITY_William_St._Take the train from ENTITY_Martin_Place or Town Hall . From Circular Quay , you have to change trains at Town Hall

Why do n't you take a weekly or monthly ticket of the public transport -LRB- depends on how long you 'd like to stay -RRB- ? So you can use either the bus or the train to the city and back and all around the city then . Going by train -LRB- from ENTITY_Kings X station -RRB- would take you about 15 minutes but you must change trains at Townhall or you 'd take the 311 bus line from Circular Quay to top of the X which takes you 45 minutes -LRB- because it 's driving a large detour -RRB- . Another option is buying a ENTITY_Sydney pass for either 3,5 or 7 days -LRB- bloody expensive , but worth the money cause you can get lots for it -RRB- and using this on either the red or the blue Explorer buses which both are heading for Kings X -LRB- the blue one is faster from Circular Quay than the red one cause it takes another route which will make you arrive there after around 10 minutes already or so depending on the traffic -RRB- .
