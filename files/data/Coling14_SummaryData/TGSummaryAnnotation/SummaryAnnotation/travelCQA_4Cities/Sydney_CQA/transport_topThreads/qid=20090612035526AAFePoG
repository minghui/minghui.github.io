Parking is a headache in ENTITY_Sydney , expensive and hard to find , and the traffic is crazy . As much as i like to bring my own car wherever i go , in big cities like ENTITY_Sydney , it 's MUCH easier to get around by trains and buses . I lived in ENTITY_Sydney for a few years and ended up leaving my car behind when i had to get around because the public transport was just so much easier , particularly considering how hard it was to find a single spot to park .

Taxi 's are quite exy , and considering your staying here for 5 - 7 days , i think renting a car is more suitable . But then again , its up to you . =-RRB- Have fun in ENTITY_Sydney
