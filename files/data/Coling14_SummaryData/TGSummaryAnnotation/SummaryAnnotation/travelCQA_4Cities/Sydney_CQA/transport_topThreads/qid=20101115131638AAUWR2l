If you are picking up the car from the airport , you will be restricted to the major rental companies . But if you arrange to pick the vehicle up from where you are staying -LRB- ie your hotel -RRB- , there are a huge number of companies . Personally , I would recommend you stick with one of the major companies . Yes ... there are plenty of cheaper options . But when you are travelling the distances you are talking about , you want the roadside service and exchange options that are only available from the larger companies . Have a lovely time .

One thing worth looking at is the direction of travel . it may be cheaper to travel from ENTITY_Cairns to ENTITY_Sydney than the other way . One way charges are often cheaper if you are going to a major city . Another thought is looking at relocation services , such as this one http://www.standbyrelocs.com/ or http://www.travellers-autobarn.com.au/caâ€?These are only an example and there are others . Provided you can fit within their time frames you can get good deals .

By the Way : ENTITY_Australia is the same size as the 48 states . Do you know how far it is from ENTITY_Sydney to ENTITY_Cairns ? It is 2630 KM 's up the ENTITY_Pacific and Bruce Highways and it will take you five days . ENTITY_Google map says 1 day 8 hours but that is assuming you drive 24 hours per day and do not stop , and that is stupid .

In this regard you can log on to sites like Yatra.com , they will provide you with all the details regarding car hiring , hotels and everything . Hope that helps
