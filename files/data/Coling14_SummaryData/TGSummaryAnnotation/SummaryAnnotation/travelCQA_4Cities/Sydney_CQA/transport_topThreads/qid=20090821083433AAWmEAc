I 'm planning on staying in ENTITY_Sydney for an extended amount of time , so how good is the transportation system ? I wo n't be limited to downtown and was wondering how easy it is to get around the city or if ENTITY_Sydney is a place where you need to have a car .

Personally survived without a car in the inner west for about 7 years . Could go back to no car now no problems . Most of my friends in the area tend not to have cars , of just use them for groceries and road trips on weekends . If you 're out near ENTITY_Penrith or something you would probably need it a lot more .

You 'll get much quicker around by trains and buses than by car . I used to live in ENTITY_Sydney and i stopped using my car when getting around in the city centre , the public transport was just so much cheaper and more time-efficient .

Public transport is not very good . If you are just here on short term on work or so and will live near your workplace , then its ok . But then , choose your living location well . But life can be constrained without a car . ENTITY_Sydney is not like ENTITY_Singapore or ENTITY_Hong_Kong where you can live for 10 years without a car .

There are many areas , like my area , where public transport is appallingly bad . Buses once an hour and they stop at around 7pm . Make sure you will be living near a train station . That will make life a lot easier . If you are living some distance out of town , you have to allow extra time to get to and from work for being stuck in peak hour traffic . If you are on holiday , then you need to avoid the morning and afternoon peak hours .

A tourist probably does n't need a car . Most of the tourist things are in/near the Central Business District . There is rail service further afield and tours that run even more than that -LRB- like to the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains -RRB- . If you 're there for business you may need other transport . Again depending on the range you may be fine with taxis , but you may need your own car otherwise .
