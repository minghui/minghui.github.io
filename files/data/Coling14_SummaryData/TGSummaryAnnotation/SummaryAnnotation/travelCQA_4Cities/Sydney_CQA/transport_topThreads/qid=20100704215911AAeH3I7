As an alternative you can catch the XPT Train from Brisbane to Central (Sydney), it's an easy bus to Brisbane from the Gold Coast. The train portion costs from $91.18 for an economy seat (there is a first class seat $128.30 option). This is an overnight trip and takes about 14 hours for the train trip. The XPT has onboard dining options (at extra cost take cash). Greyhound: http://www.greyhound.com.au Countrylink (XPT service): http://www.countrylink.info

Prices vary between $100 and $185, depending on when you buy and whether you want fully refundable tickets. http://www.greyhound.com.au/ Flying is the fastest way to get to Sydney, and Jetstar have some really cheap prices. But you also need to include the cost of a taxi or shuttle to the Gold Coast Airport, and cost of the train from Sydney Airport into the city. http://www.jetstar.com/au/en/index.aspx

Greyhound - Tickets from $88 Sydney-Brisbane. Takes 16 and a half hours. Premier Motor Service - Tickets $93 Sydney-Brisbane. Takes 17 and a half hours. I'd go with Greyhound, it's quicker and is slightly cheaper. Or, as someone above me said, take the train. It costs $91.50 to get to Brisbane and only takes 14 and a half hours. It has a restaurant on board as well.
