You may find notices posting of travellers doing the same trip who have a spare seat in their van and want to fill it in exchange for petrol money and company . Its quite common to do this . Or you could writeup a notice yourself saying `` seat wanted '' and post it up Alternatively check out greyhound busses . I have n't travelled with them before but know many people who have . You can buy passes which give you unlimited travel on their busses for a certain area , or number of days or km or something . So you can check out their routes and jump on/off . Also check out the classifieds on http://www.gumtree.com.au and click on ENTITY_sydney and look under travel , sometimes there are posts there too for spare seats !

That way you have the freedom to see what you want to see and stop when you want . That is a long journey . Hope you enjoy . You will see some beautiful places on the way . Alternate your return journey to your trip up to ENTITY_Cairns . Stop at different places on the way south .
