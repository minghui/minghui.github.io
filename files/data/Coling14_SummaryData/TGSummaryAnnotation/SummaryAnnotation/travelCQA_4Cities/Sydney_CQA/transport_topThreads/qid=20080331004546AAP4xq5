I have to catch a bus to ENTITY_Parramatta station and a train to ENTITY_North_Sydney . It takes me about 90 minutes . The bus to the station in the mornings is n't too bad but in the afternoons , you can never rely on it . It is usually late and the traffic through the main centre of ENTITY_Parramatta can make a 25 minute bus trip extend to an hour . As for the trains , they 're usually on time or within a couple of minutes , so that does n't worry me too much , it 's just how crowded they are . In the mornings , I rarely get a seat and travelling for 50 minutes standing up on a moving train with people pushing past you to get on and off is annoying . In the afternoons , I will get a seat because I get on before it gets to the city but the train is still so crowded . I do n't know how they could ever fix it , whether they could put more trains on or not but so many people are living out west and my trains are either the ENTITY_Richmond or ENTITY_Penrith trains . Overall , it 's not too bad . I just hate travelling into the city where everybody is in a rush to go nowhere and hardly anybody shows any respect . Everybody has to push up stairs or on and off trains . Another thing , my train in the afternoon on Monday and Tuesday smelt like vomit . I could n't see it but the whole carriage smelt . People were getting on and then changing seats but you could n't get away from it . I do n't know whether it was in the seat or where it was . Having said that , my rating would be 7 .

qid=20080331004546AAP4xq5_answer_6	2	qid=20080331004546AAP4xq5	2008-04-01 00:56:43 +0000	answer	 Rating 3 , it 's dirty , not on time , confusing , too expensive and congested . You rarely get an anouncement and if you do you ca n't understand the guy cos they are speaking too soft or they have some wierd *** bloody accent that is so thick you ca n't understand it . I know my way around ENTITY_Sydney very very well - i would not want to be a tourist trying to get somewhere , it is difficult enough when you know what your 're doing and where you are going . I was on a train once at Central - i thought the guy said we were at ENTITY_Strathfield . ENTITY_City_Rail needs to employ Australians who can speak clear english and know where things are .

I have to travel to ENTITY_Heathcote by train nd bus everyday to get to work & home again ... I catch 4 trains and a bus ! I have to be honest when i say that i am VERY happy with it . My rating = 8 & 1/2 I guess the trains cold come more often . . Maybe every 15 minutes instead of every half hour or hour . Alot of people have diffent versions of public transport . even some people have judgement when they have n't even tryed it . I guess if they just came more often i would give it a 9 & 1/2 out of 10 . . Other than that i think it 's great . I completly recommened public transport as not only is it saving the enviroment . . Its very easy and effective . =] Hope that helped . .
