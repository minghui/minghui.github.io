I did the trip from ENTITY_Sydney to Mo -LRB- ENTITY_Warsaw and ENTITY_Sedalia -RRB- and return to ENTITY_Sydney , and that cost $ 2275.00 , I had to take a weeks leave of absence for a funeral .

Flight bookings can only be made 12 months in advance , so ticket prices are at current prices , no-one knows how much a ticket will cost in two years . At the moment prices are around US$ 2100 to more than US$ 3000 for a round trip in Economy/Coach Class . There is no direct flight from ENTITY_Missouri to ENTITY_Sydney . You would have to go to an airport such as ENTITY_Springfield , fly from there to ENTITY_Chicago or another major city , then fly to ENTITY_Los_Angeles to get a flight to ENTITY_Sydney .

Living in Aussie or travelling around it VERY expensive . Remember also our buck is worth more than yours too . What exactly are you going to live on while here if just the fare is such a big hurdle ? Suggest you find an Architect . He will have a drawing board you can sit at to rethink your whole strategy . Or did n't anyone tell you ? Yo need a whole lot of money besides airfare to come to Aussie mate . You 're not by any chance someone who could be tagged a '' Hillbilly '' are you ? Everybody else would know this -- is my point .

You need to do your own homework before even worrying about air fares , otherwise you might get turned around and sent back as soon as you get off the plane .
