Caught a train to the city , bought a ticket on a sightseeing bus and spend the available time seeing all I could , before having to get back to the airport .

I think it 's about a half hour trip . Or ferry to manley if you prefer . Also you can get the train to Central station and visit ENTITY_China town and easy short walk from Central . I recently had a delicous meal there for $ 8 . They put the train fare up quite a lot for the airport so get a return ticket and say you want to use it for the ferry as well . I do n't think you will sigh when you take a look around 8 hours would be excellent but I guess you will need to be back at the airport well before boarding to get through customs in time . maybe an hour and a half or so before your next flight . make sure your luggage is forwarded on so you are not lugging it around

THey did give us a lunch voucher , but it was a long damn day . There are a few shops to go and look at , but I suggest you take a book , some crosswords and an ipod to pass the time !!

If you are transiting through ENTITY_Sydney than you can just sit in the transit lounge with a good book . Talking to others helps pass the time too .
