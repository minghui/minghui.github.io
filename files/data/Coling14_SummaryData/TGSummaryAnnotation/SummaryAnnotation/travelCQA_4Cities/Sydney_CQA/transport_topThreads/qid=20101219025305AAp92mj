Save money by NOT owning a car with petrol , registration , insurance , maintenance etc. . Average costs on PT weekly are roughly 25-50 weekly , of course depends how far away from uni you are . Buses are generally best when travelling around uni 's .

Though it does depend on what you class as `` ENTITY_Sydney '' if you are out in the suburbs driving is probably not so bad . Public transport is alright , except for really late at night , but then , I just get a taxi ...

Where I live -LRB- Inner West -RRB- , there are lots of trains and buses to get around with so cars are n't as necessary . Besides , parking is very expensive in the CBD and on uni campuses . I commute to uni and have had no problems apart from myself missing the trains . To be honest , I do n't know much people who drive to uni .

A car is handy if travelling to the beaches or farther afield but then parking is a problem unless you have off street parking where you are staying .
