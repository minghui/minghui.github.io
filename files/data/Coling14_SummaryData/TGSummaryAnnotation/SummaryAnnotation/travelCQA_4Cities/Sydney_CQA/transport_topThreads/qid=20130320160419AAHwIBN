Assuming you are trying to keep the cost down , let 's say you 'll probably spend 20 Dollars a day on food . It is going to be cheaper if you cook it yourself , but you will eat out some days as well , and seeing that even a maccas meal is about 10 dollars I 'd say it 'll come up to an average of 20 a day . That means 30 days x 20AUD = 600AUD food . If you are going to stay in hostels for the other 3 weeks which cost between 20-30 dollars a night in a dorm you 'll look at average 25AUD x 21 nights = 525 dollars for accommodation . You say your transport is all paid for , but does this include getting around in the cities you will go to ? Have a look at the local public transport websites . I know that a return ticket in ENTITY_Sydney is between 6-10 dollars , a multi stop day ticket 22 . You did not say which cities you want to visit and if you are going to use public transport at all , so I ca n't calculate that for you . There are a couple of free museums and lots of free outdoor things to see and do in ENTITY_Australia , but if you are going to visit stuff that costs money , it 'll most likely be something like 10-20 for a museum and 20-50 for zoos , amusement parks etc. . Let 's say you are visiting something 2 days a week at an average of 30 AUD x 6 = 180 AUD for admission prices . So at the moment it comes up to about 1300 AUD . On top of that I would calculate public transport , going out for a drink -LRB- av . beer price between 4-5AUD a half-pint -RRB- , sending postcards , buying souvenirs and whatever else you spend money on .

A coffee is around $ 5 , a bucket of hot chips around $ 5 . Most attractions to visit ie the zoo , the aquarium etc have an entry fee of around $ 35 . A movie ticket is around $ 16 . Public transport is reasonable but depending on where you go , maybe up to $ 20 a day . Lots of things are free and if your Accomodation is in the city , you can walk lots of places . Taxis are expensive , stick to public transport ie trains , trams , ferries or buses -LRB- depending where you go -RRB- . So , I 'd budget for $ 100 a day . 30 days is around $ 3,000 . Obviously you could spend a lot less or a lot more depending on what you do , where you do it and what and where you eat .

My answers will be in Australian dollars Takeaway -LRB- as we say in ENTITY_Australia -RRB- is $ 5-10 , cheap meals $ 10-20 . A beer is around $ 5 . Public transport is not cheap , you might spend $ 10 a day on transport . Hotels are the worst . Camping can be free in some places , dorm backpacker accommodation starts around $ 30 for a bed , motels maybe $ 100 a night -LRB- often with cooking facilities -RRB- , hotels $ 200 . The good news is that there is a lot to see for free , like beaches , hikes , museums etc. . So you probably want $ 200 a day including accommodation . Though you can probably get that under $ 100 . Some people use air ENTITY_BnB or couchsurfing to find cheaper places to stay .

So , a minimum of A$ 8,000 but preferably A$ 10,000 . And do n't forget travel insurance for the whole 4 weeks before you leave home ! Australian dollars , not American .
