There are plenty of places / towns with motels to stop along the way - no problems . It will take about that long driving non-stop from ENTITY_Sydney to ENTITY_Melbourne -LRB- unless of course you want to risk getting picked up fr speeding -RRB-

Take the M5 all the way to albury/wodonga which turns into the ENTITY_Hume Hwy.It 's easy , the roads have been recently upgraded and there are plenty of places to stop on the way for overnight accomodation . Try Gundagai or ENTITY_Albury for a stop . It 's only 3?1/2 hours from albury to ENTITY_melbourne .

As for Motels their are lots , every town has a Motel . The road is good and double lane 's most of the tip . Also there are lots of ENTITY_Riggs up and down the highway . See lots of trucks stopped at a road house , means the food is good and the price is right . Hope this helps good luck Waltz

There are lots of motels available but trip will take about 12 hours so you can probably do in one day . The biggest town in the middle is ENTITY_Albury , population approx 50,000 . Also keep in mind that in August the sun will set around 5:30 so if you leave late you will be completing a large part of your journey driving at night

The inland route is faster and the road is better - freeway most of the way . However the ENTITY_Pacific_Hwy has more towns and sights along the way if you want to take it easy .

Most of the people do this in one day because they prefer to spend the night in ENTITY_Melbourne .
