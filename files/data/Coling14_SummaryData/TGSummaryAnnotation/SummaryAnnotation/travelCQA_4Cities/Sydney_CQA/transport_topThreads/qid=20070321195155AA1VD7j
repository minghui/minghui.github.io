Tax will cost from $ 25 - $ 35 during the day , depending on traffic . Very early morning -LRB- before 6am -RRB- or late at night -LRB- after 8pm -RRB- expect to pay about $ 25 . There is also a $ 2 airport fee that is added to all cab tariffs departing from the airport . Museum station is the closest station , its approx 10 mins walk -LRB- allowing for the fact you may have baggage -RRB- . You need to go to the ENTITY_Liverpool St exit -LRB- Hyde Park -RRB- . Train fares are approx $ 10 oneway from the airport to the city circle -LRB- ENTITY_Redfern , Central , Town Hall , Wynyard , Circular Quay , Museum , ENTITY_St_James_,_Kings_Cross_&_Martin_Place -RRB- . The ENTITY_Travelodge has just become a part of the Toga group & is now a member of the Velocity travel program -LRB- Virgin group -RRB- . If you are travelling alone , I recommend you use the train but if there are more than 2 people it will be cheaper to use a taxi or hotel shuttle service . Also look at buying a TRAVELPASS weekly or monthly for local government transport -LRB- buses , trains & ferries -RRB- . . forget the tourist express buses . . they are a waste of money & very expensive . Hope you enjoy your trip to ENTITY_Sydney :--RRB- -RRB- -RRB-

Check out http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=d&hl=enâ€?It's around 18km , 24 mins by taxi would cost around 30 to 40 dollars depending on the time of day . Another option would be to get the train from ENTITY_sydney airport to central station , then central station to town hall . That 'll cost you about 10 bucks .

You are joking . You do n't need to tip taxi drivers in ENTITY_Australia and they do n't expect it . You can if you want to but do n't bring nasty ENTITY_American habits over here , thanks . You can sit in a taxi and wait for change and you will get it without a murmur .

Check out the website www.cityrail.nsw.gov.au for more information .
qid=20070321195155AA1VD7j_answer_5	2	qid=20070321195155AA1VD7j	2007-03-22 04:50:36 +0000	answer	 Some great tips here - you wo n't get lost :-RRB- It 's very simple - depending on traffic conditions between $ 25 - $ 35 with a $ 5 tip . Even though ENTITY_Sydney_Airport says $ 25 -30 . The hotel location is well known and these streets should be very well known by all cab drivers . There 's some more info and links here on taxis : http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/SACL/To+â€?For your curiosity the location can be found here at http://www.whereis.com.au and printed out on a map which you can take with you , to show the cab driver !! I noticed that you are staying at the Travelodge and thought that you might like to be aware of the rates available through this directory and compare what 's on offer : http://www.cheaperthanhotels.com.au/Austâ€?The last minute rates often have free inclusions . I was curious to see if you got a good deal or not . Have a great time is ENTITY_Sydney .

There is another exit across the road which will be easier but it means lagging your luggage up some stairs . Might just be easier to take a taxi from central and get them to drop you right at the door of the ENTITY_Travellodge - I expect that would cost about $ 5 to $ 10 .

Use whereis.com.au for future reference . Have a nice time in ENTITY_sydney_Shanks http://www.melbourne-travel-guide.com
