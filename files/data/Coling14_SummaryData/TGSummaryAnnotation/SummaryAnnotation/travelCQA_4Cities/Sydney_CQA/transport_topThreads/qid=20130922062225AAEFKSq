It would be phenomenally expensive . It costs me almost $ 100 just from ENTITY_Sydney to my place in the ENTITY_Western_Suburbs_of_Sydney . I ca n't imagine what it would case to get to ENTITY_Newcastle . You can go by bus or train very easily . I once took a taxi from ENTITY_Germany through ENTITY_Austria and back to a different city in ENTITY_Germany . That was because there was no other way , the weather was so bad the buses were n't running , and it was actually only a very short distance - a taxi driver offered , and it turned out to be the best and most comfortable solution to the problem .

What the others have said about paying for the return trip is correct but there is one extra point . If you took a taxi from ENTITY_Newcastle to ENTITY_Sydney , you can ask the driver to wait for you and s/he is required to wait for an hour -LRB- but no more -RRB- to take you back . If you return to ENTITY_Newcastle within the hour , the return trip is free as you have already paid for it . Some of the longest taxi trips in ENTITY_Australia were undertaken by the eccentric ENTITY_Bea_Miles . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bea_Miles
