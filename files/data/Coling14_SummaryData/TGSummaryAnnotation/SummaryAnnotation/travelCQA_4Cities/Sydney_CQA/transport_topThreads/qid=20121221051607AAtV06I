My boyfriend is coming from the ENTITY_Philippines to ENTITY_Sydney In January . But his route is a stop over in ENTITY_Cairns . But he only has his ticket to fly to ENTITY_Cairns . I was thinking about going by coach/travel bus to pick him up from ENTITY_Cairns airport and go back to ENTITY_Sydney with him so he does not have to try and buy another ticket , as hes having allot of trouble getting a ticket from ENTITY_Cairns to ENTITY_Sydney and i want to help some way . How do i go about this ? Is this a good possible option . How long would the bus trip be from there and back ? how much ? Im a concession if anything . But how much would it cost by coach for both of us and for me to go by coach and come back . Thank you much appreciated . And please do n't just give me links or tell me to use ENTITY_google . This is a serious question and i 've had to ask it twice now because the first time people were rude .

The cheapest , easiest , and most comfortable way to do it is to fly . There are various airlines that do the route , shop around for the best deal . Budget airlines charge extra for meals and baggage , take those extra costs into consideration when comparing prices . You can go by bus . The initial fare will be lower than the air fare but the trip takes two and a half to three days and you will need to add on the cost of all your meals and drinks on the way . You can also do it by train and if you are tall , trains are better than the bus though more expensive . You still need to buy meals and drinks on the train and it takes as long as the bus . Prices vary but there are comprehensive web sites that compare prices for you so you will need to use ENTITY_Google to check and compare the costs .

A stopover is a stopover - it has to continue on to somewhere else . The bus trip from ENTITY_Sydney to ENTITY_Cairns takes days . I know , because I once did it . Stupidly . Ca n't you buy him a cheap ENTITY_Jetstar or ENTITY_Tiger_Airways flight to ENTITY_Sydney anyway ? It 's possible to buy flights online for another person , I do it all the time for my family members . All he needs to do is to front up at the check in counter with some ID . It does sound a little dodgy to me . Be sure you 're not doing anything illegal here , if your boyfriend does n't have the right sort of visa , they wo n't let him into ENTITY_Australia .

It is cheapest to fly . Why does n't he book online before he leaves the ENTITY_Philippines .
