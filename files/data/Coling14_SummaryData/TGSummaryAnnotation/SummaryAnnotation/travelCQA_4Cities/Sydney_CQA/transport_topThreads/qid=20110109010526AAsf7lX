I was thinking that me and friends -LRB- we 're all around 16 -RRB- were going to go to tropfest ENTITY_Australia this February . However it ends at 10:30 pm , and we 'd probably have to catch a train back home after that . Is it dangerous to traverse at that time ? I do n't think there 's going to many of us , maybe 2-4 .

Even so , here are a few pointers : * Do n't loiter around the entrance to the station . * Wait on the platform as a group near the area marked `` nightride '' in blue on the ground . * Stand near other people you feel comfortable with . The more conservatively dressed the better . * Only enter train carriages with a blue light shining above the guards door . These are the ones with a guard on board . If you have any trouble see the guard . * Absolutely do not enter totally empty carriages . If you find yourself in one , then move to another carriage that has people you feel comfortable with inside . Otherwise change carriages to the blue lit one at the first opportunity . * plan your route and make sure you know what time your train is leaving -LRB- and the next one after that too in case you miss it -RRB- * keep a mobile phone on you in case you need assistance . * Note that the nearest station to the area in the Domain where Tropfest is being held is ENTITY_St_James_Station . * Be sure to have valid tickets as there will be regular patrols by train security staff through the carriages after 10pm . If you have any problems these guys can help you too .

The good thing is you wo n't be alone , it 's always best to travel in a group especially at night . If at all possible , try look out for guards and stick close by them . Last time I caught a train home it was after 11pm and there were guards on the station and in the train . Just be wary of your surroundings and others at all times .

I work in the Security Industry.I see all the bad stuff so I know about this . There is NO way I would allow a kid of mine at 16 on a ENTITY_Sydney train at 10-30 or later . And if your parents love you , they wont want you on that train either .

If you 're heading out to ENTITY_Penrith or into the ENTITY_Shire then I 'd think twice ... But if you 're headed somewhere that 's not a gang/idiot prone area , and you stick together , and you 're sensible then you 'll be fine ... Make sure that you plan how you 're going to get from the station too !!

Stay close to the guard 's carriage -LRB- fifth carriage -RRB- . Wait in the ` nightsafe ' area on the platform marked in blue to be near the guard 's carriage when the train pulls up .
