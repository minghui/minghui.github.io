Of course depending on tailwind or head wind component, and what crew is on, and whether or not the Captain has a snooze or a few sherbets (hope not). Time difference is, if its say 9am west coast LA it is approx around 5pm back home east coast (the next day of course). By the way, when your over there, if you want the cheapest way to phone Australia, go to seven eleven and buy the pre paid $5 0r $10 calling card, its good value.

If you have the time needed by the plane just had it to the 7am55. Example: The Air company say 10 hours of fly between Sydney and LA. If u leave Sydney at 1pm55 you will arrived to LA at 5pm55.

Don't forget that you will cross the International Date Line so you need to adjust your calender by 1 day. Without knowing the flight time I can't tell you when you will arrive. Call the airline and ask them for an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) Ian M
