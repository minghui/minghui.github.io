Hotels like that run at least $ 100 , and about $ 125 - $ 150 in the summer . That 's just the financial reality here in ENTITY_LA. . Since LA is so spread out , there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING . Most people who come here tend to stay in ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , or ENTITY_Anaheim . In ENTITY_Hollywood , I recommend the Orchid Suites , ENTITY_Hollywood_Celebrity_Hotel , or Holiday Inn Walk of Fame , all near ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland . Another one is the ENTITY_Best_Western_Sunset_Plaza . In ENTITY_Santa_Monica , the ENTITY_Holiday_Inn_Santa_Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced . In ENTITY_Anaheim , I recommend the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson -LRB- HoJo -RRB- ENTITY_Anaheim , and the Candy Cane Inn . There is also a nice place in ENTITY_Burbank called the ENTITY_Best_Western_Media_Center , very close to ENTITY_Warner , ENTITY_NBC , and ENTITY_Universal_Studios . If you want something $ 70 - $ 90 in a `` shopping district '' , try the Days Inn ENTITY_South_Lenwood , just outside of ENTITY_Barstow . You can shop at the Lenwood Outlet Mall .

ENTITY_LA 's pretty expensive . You 're better off spending more and staying in a desirable area ` cuz you 'll spend it on gas or a taxi anyway if you stay in the ` cheap ' areas . http://www.palosverdesinn.com/index.html That 's a very good hotel for the price in a terrific area -LRB- ENTITY_Redondo_Beach -RRB- . It 's not a glamorous hotel , but it has a great restaurant inside , it 's walking distance to the beach , very safe area , and it 's a five minute cab ride to ENTITY_Del_Amo mall which is the second largest mall in the country -LRB- which also has tons of restaurants , movie theaters , etc in it -RRB- . You can get the cheapest room there for around $ 120/night . ENTITY_Redondo_Beach is about 20 minutes south of ENTITY_LA. . It 's also walking distance to the ENTITY_Hollywood_Riviera area which has tons of cute little boutique shops and beach bars . I usually recommend this hotel to friends who are coming to visit ENTITY_LA. .

There 's shopping everywhere , no matter where you stay -LRB- for your budget -RRB- you will have to drive or take the bus to shopping areas -- but not to worry there are plenty of shopping experiences around ENTITY_Los_Angeles .
