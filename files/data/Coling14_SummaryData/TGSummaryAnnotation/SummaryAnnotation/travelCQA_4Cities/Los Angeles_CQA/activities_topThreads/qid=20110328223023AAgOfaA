Me and some friends have made a plan to take a trip to ENTITY_California before high school , in summer . None of us have ever been there , so we just have questions . Do you have to buy a beach house , or can you rent one for a few weeks , or do some of them work like hotels ? What is a cheap airline ? Or would a road trip be cheaper ? We 're just gon na earn the money ourselves , so nothing First Class . I 've never been on an airplane , or out of ENTITY_Missouri for that matter , so I 'm kinda lost . Haha . We 're probably going to go to ENTITY_Los_Angeles , and maybe stay in ENTITY_Hollywood -LRB- depending on the price -RRB- , or maybe ENTITY_Long_Beach or ENTITY_Irvine . And with ENTITY_Disneyland , is it like Six Flags ? Do you have to buy a Season Pass to get in without paying every time , or do you just pay at the gate and all the rides are free ?

It will run into the thousands . www.vrbo.com is a good website for vacation rentals . ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Irvine and ENTITY_Los_Angeles are n't on the water . You can buy multiday tickets for ENTITY_Disneyland . Once you get in the rides are free . Look on the ENTITY_Disneyland website to find out the prices . Buying your airline tickets in advance is usually a good way to save money . Try ENTITY_expedia.com , ENTITY_travelocity.com or priceline.com to compare ticket prices of several airlines and hotels . You are going to need to earn over $ 2000 if you plan on staying here longer than a week . Rental car , plane tickets , food , hotel , souvenirs , ENTITY_Disneyland , gasoline , a possible beachfront vacation rental , etc are all pretty expensive . It 's cool that you plan on earning the money yourself . Good luck !

Or you can get a room in a hotel on the beach . But they are pretty much two different things . You wo n't find a whole house where you can just show up and stay for a night or two and they make your bed every night . Flying is probably cheaper when you factor gas and hotels along the way . But the problem is that you 'll need a car in ENTITY_California -LRB- Southern California especially is not public-transportation-friendly -RRB- . Rental car agencies wo n't let people under a certain age rent cars . So bring your own . You do need to pay per day for ENTITY_Disneyland or get a season pass . But unlike Six Flags , where the price for a season pass is often less than the price for two days , I think the ENTITY_Disneyland season pass only makes sense if you 're going to be back several times . Check the ticket prices online to be sure .
