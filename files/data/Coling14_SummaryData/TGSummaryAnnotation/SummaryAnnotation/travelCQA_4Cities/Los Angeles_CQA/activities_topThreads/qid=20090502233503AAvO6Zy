Try typing `` Hotels on ENTITY_Catalina_Island '' in your browser and you 'll find dozens of sites . June is the start of tourist season . It may start to be crowded , and reservations may be hard to get . ENTITY_Catalina is a small island , and Avalon is the only town of any consequence . In actuality you can see most of what is on the island in one day , but longer stays can also be interesting . If you stay on weekends most hotels require you book a 2 day minimum stay . Prices can range from moderate to VERY expensive depending on the amenities offered . -LRB- Most -RRB- cars are prohibited on the island so you 'll have to walk , or rent bicycles , or golf carts to get around . There is no taxi service . The town is so small that this is not a problem . The boat usually offers a pretty stable ride , but it is best to eat AFTER you arrive on the island . Take an inland tour and see the herd of ENTITY_American_Bison there . Enjoy your stay on ENTITY_Catalina .

You can also input catalina tourism in google for options too . Bet it to be expensive , theres only so many rooms so the prices I just saw on trip advisor were high !

It 's not like ENTITY_Vegas , where large corporations own hotels and can offer big discounts . These are basically family-run hotels , pretty much all boutique hotels . There are no big chain hotels , so do n't expect big discounts .
