However , if you are not comfortable driving in ENTITY_LA , you can use public transportation . It 's not the best , but you can make it work , I have friends visit all the time who do n't want to drive so I send them out on public transportation when I 'm working . You will want to have a plan . Look at a map and see where the things are that you want to go to , you can do that on ENTITY_Google_Maps . Figure out which places you should see on the same day , and then plan the routes on ENTITY_Google_Maps -LRB- the little bus icon is for public transportation routes -RRB- , or at www.metro.net If one of you has an iPhone you can figure public transportation routes on the map . Or you can ask here which places you might go on the same days . Like you would want to go to downtown LA and see Olvera Street , ENTITY_Little_Tokyo , and ENTITY_Chinatown in the same afternoon as they are walkable , and right near Union Station . There are also other things to see downtown , and Dodger Stadium is nearby . You 'd want to see ENTITY_Santa_Monica_Pier_&_Beach and ENTITY_Venice_Beach_&_Boardwalk on the same day , they are next to each other . Hollywood and The Grove/Farrners Market and ENTITY_Beverly_Hills could be done on one day . Good luck !

It does n't cover the entire city like the subway in NYC , but it is reliable , clean and safe public transportation to quite a few areas .

You can also use the Downtown Area Short Hop buses which run between ENTITY_Hollywood , the Westside and downtown every 5 to 20 minutes depending on time of day . Here 's the website . www.ladottransit.com Look into shuttle services too . For instance , the ENTITY_Anaheim_Shuttle_Service runs to/from ENTITY_Universal_City to ENTITY_Disneyland twice daily . You must buy a ticket to ENTITY_Universal_Studios Tour/Theme Park in order to take advantage of the shuttle service . Information here . www.universalstudioshollywood.com You can get a three-day ENTITY_California_City Pass which includes admission to ENTITY_Disneyland , ENTITY_Disney 's ENTITY_California Adventure , ENTITY_Universal and the ENTITY_San_Diego_Zoo .
