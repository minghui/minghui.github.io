I 'm 2 blocks from the beach and within walking distance to bars , restaurants and shopping . I feel safe at night and even take walks after midnight with a friend and we feel safe . If you stay close to the ocean you will see some great old houses and apartment buildings . ENTITY_North_Long_Beach on the other hand is bad , but you wo n't be anywhere near there . LB is a large city , over 450,000 people live here and it covers over 50 square miles . If you want to see a live web cam pic of LB click on the ENTITY_ABC_news link below .

It is as safe as any where else in the country and safer than many . Lots of great hotels in town but if you can stay at the Queen ENTITY_Mary it 's a kick . Also there are good hotels downtown and in the ENTITY_Belmont shore area which is one of the nicer areas of LB . Do n't worry . Like most movies there is a lot of drama and hype involved . You will have a great time and your safety is pretty much gauranteed . Congrats to your Nephew .
