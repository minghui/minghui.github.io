It 's hauntingly beautiful , you can enjoy the pleasures of nearby ENTITY_Lake_Tahoe and the challenge of the ENTITY_Sierra_Nevada , and there was this historic hotel at ENTITY_Truckee which was really a retreat . Great place to spend some quality down time . Good food , fresh air , beautiful land and no traffic or tourist crowds . And the beach on ENTITY_Donner_Lake is great fun in spring and the summer .

But do spend at least a long weekend if you go - it is too long a drive otherwise . ENTITY_Whale_Watch_Inn in ENTITY_Gualala is a great place to stay , or go all the way to ENTITY_Mendocino - check out their website for a number of great places to stay . Napa/Sonoma . Do some wine tasting , bike ride together , walks etc. . There are many nice B&B s. SF , if you like art , history and city stuff , also good food - can be very romantic but beware of the bums . ENTITY_Half_Moon_Bay . Peaceful . Great ocean views . The ENTITY_Half_Moon_Bay_Lodge is a nice mid-road place to stay -LRB- a nice price performer -RRB- or you can splurge on the Ritz . Yosemite . Do not miss seeing the Ahwahnee as well as all the beautiful scenery . Also splurge and have dinner at ENTITY_Ernas_Elderberry_House . 5 ENTITY_Stars_! ENTITY_Tahoe .

ENTITY_santa_monica , ENTITY_santa_clara , all the bay area . thats pretty nice just driving through and going to the beach and stuff . all up against the coast is pretty . just have an open mind when coming up here .

If you guys ai n't to nature than there 's no point in going ENTITY_North . I personally like -LRB- starting from the southern most part of the north -RRB- ENTITY_Monterey , ENTITY_Carmel , ENTITY_Napa , ENTITY_South_Lake_Tahoe , ENTITY_Yosemite , and ENTITY_Eureka . I 'm under the age of 30 and like the outdoors but not really into hiking ... I like chilling and taking in a different scenary , my fav out of all is ENTITY_South_Lake_Tahoe . They have casino 's , shopping , the LAKE , skiing if you go during the right time , and very friendly people . FUN TRAVELS .
