I 'm heading to ENTITY_LA with my special someone , and was wondering about a ballpark figure on how much I should prepare . I 've gotten a good rental car deal at $ 130 for the week . We 're planning to check out ENTITY_Disney , ENTITY_Universal , ENTITY_Magic_Mountain , ENTITY_Hollywood , and maybe go around downtown LA or OC . Any ideas ? I 'm still scouring the net and craigslist for half-off tickets for the theme parks , was wondering how much I 'd need for food , accomodations , parking , and other stuff . We probably wo n't shop as much though , it 'll be more of a sight-seeing thing , then probably have a nice romantic dinner at the end of the week . Any suggestions ? Thanks !

Well , do n't feel like you have to buy souvenirs at those places there 's plenty of other places to get them way cheaper in ENTITY_Hollywood or surrounding areas . Bring your own food and drink to those places too becasue you could end up spending lots of money . Almost every place charges for parking , at least 10.00 for the day or more . If you do n't mind driving a little try to stay a little further out . The closer you get to those places the more expensive the hotel rooms . There 's so many things to do and see here , from free to expensive , it just depends on what you 're looking for . You might be able to get away with 40.00 a day for two people for food , if you eat at little holes-in - the walls , which can actually be very good and by eating one meal a day of your own food . Hotels can be hit and miss . If you 're booking them on the internet . They may look good , but in person they might be a dump , even the ones in ENTITY_Hollywood , but a decent , clean room would be about 89.00 + a night , a little more on the weekend . There 's some cute little places in ENTITY_Santa_Monica , by the beach that are actually motels , but they 've got character and you 'll be close to the water . Be prepared for rush hour traffic during the week days , if you can , avoid the freeways during 4pm-7pm . Have a nice visit .

If you get lucky in OC you may find a hotel for 75 per night . Universal and ENTITY_Magic_Mountain are a little less than the mouse house . Dinner in ENTITY_Laguna_Beach at the end of the week ... ... minimum 200 for the two of you . On the low end , you should probably budget about 1500 or so for the week .

First off , let me say that trying to do ENTITY_Disneyland , ENTITY_Universal_and_Magic_Mountain will just suck you dry both physically and financially . I would suggest choosing one , at the most two , of the parks and really enjoying it . If you have a ENTITY_Costco membership you can get a 4 day ENTITY_Disneyland_Pass for $ 119 ; the only catch is you have to have a SoCal zip code to trade the voucher for the ticket . If you are meeting up with SoCal friends this is the best deal around ; if not try to find some kind soul to help you out . Also be aware that ENTITY_Magic_Mountain has odd open days and times and after Labor Day is usually only open for the weekends and closes for the winter . Once you choose what you want to do , the next biggest cost will be hotels . If you will be here after Labor Day , you will find rates much more affordable . Depending on what area you stay in you should be able to find a nice Courtyard by ENTITY_Marriott or ENTITY_Hampton_Inn for around $ 100 a night . But if you want something swankier in a non-residential area be prepared to pay more . As with any trip , food costs depend on your tastes . Is a McMuffin good for breakfast ? Or do you have to have sit down service at ENTITY_Coco 's ? Find a hotel with breakfast included and then really eat up . Then have a big lunch and a snack type dinner . There are lots of things to do in the LA/OC areas that do n't cost a fortune and will be a nice way to spend time together . And unless this is your one and only trip ever to ENTITY_California , do n't think you have to do everything in one trip ! Happy travels !

Do n't forget that you can go to the grocery store and buy a picnic ... that 's always cheaper than eating in a restaurant and way better than fast food .
