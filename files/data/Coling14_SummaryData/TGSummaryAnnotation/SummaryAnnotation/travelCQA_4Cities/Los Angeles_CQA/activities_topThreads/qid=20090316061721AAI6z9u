Since my skin is dark , should I be asking you if its safe to drive into ENTITY_Hollywood during the day ??? ... . Every major city has its `` bad '' areas , but again , like any major city , stick to the main roads -LRB- even if they go through a `` bad '' area -RRB- and you should n't have any problems .

Things can happen anywhere , just be aware of your surroundings . And ... as a tourist , DO NOT give anything to any homeless , panhandlers , etc. . You have been warned .

You can take ENTITY_Century_Blvd to the 405 freeway , or you can take ENTITY_Sepulveda north or south . Perfectly fine during the day . Mind your manners , exercise the usual caution , and you 'll be just fine . Next time stay in ENTITY_Santa_Monica or ENTITY_Anaheim if you 're that worried .

DO you know how big this place is ? 95 % of greater ENTITY_LA is as safe as anywhere . Most of the bad area is surrounded by the 710 , 10 and 405 freeways . Which includes the area just east of ENTITY_LAX past the 405 . Avoid ENTITY_Compton and ENTITY_South_Central , which are inside the loop of freeways indicated . However , it is safe to drive the freeways through these areas .

The hotel there is fine , but the area surrounding the airport in not the greatest and should be avoided - though I would not worry about being shot . I grew up in the ENTITY_South_Bay area and it is wonderful . Here is how to get to the beach and a wonderful safe area that you will love . Exit the airport by making a right onto ENTITY_Sepulveda . Continue going S. on ENTITY_Sepulveda until you reach ENTITY_Artesia , at which point you will make a right toward the beach . This will dump you off on the border of ENTITY_Hermosa and ENTITY_Manhattan_Beach , two wonderful beach towns . Check out the ENTITY_Hermosa_Beach_Pier for nightlife , surfing , shopping , and restaurants . Check out the ENTITY_Manhattan_Beach pier area for high-end restaurants and shops . Some other good places to check out are ENTITY_Santa_Monica 's 3rd St. Prominade -LRB- a lot of homeless people there though because there are not loitering laws , so go in the day -RRB- and the ENTITY_Getty_Museum , which is spectacular and completely safe . It 's free but you have to pay a few bucks to park . It is safe here , driving through ENTITY_Inglewood is not a big deal , just do n't stop there and hang out , and you will be totally fine . Some places downtown LA are also not the greatest . For example , the Hollywood Walk of Fame in not in the best area . You will be fine , do n't worry about anything . Be advised that you must rent a car though because public transportation here is awful .
