There are loads of hotels right around it that offer shuttle service straight to the gate . And , if you are able to buy your ticket ahead of time , you can get a good deal on a park hopper ticket , that will let you into to both D land and ENTITY_CA adventure .

Stay at the ENTITY_Best_Western or ENTITY_Motel 6 south . Great beach , fun little beach town to explore , ENTITY_Santa_Barbara is 15 minutes away : More beaches , the Mission , ENTITY_State_Street . ENTITY_Pismo_Beach : Nice beach , cute little beach town . Plenty of hotels to choose from . GREAT clam chowder at Splash Cafe . Really , when you think about it , you just want a change of venue and to get out of the heat . The beach or the mountains both do that . Big Bear might also be an option .

Earlier this year we did a `` staycation '' in ENTITY_Pasadena . It was 38 miles from our house but we do n't go out there very often . There are n't very many big attrations but it was still fun . the Childrens Mueseum at the Rose Bowl was really nice . And there is an old fashion soda fountain in ENTITY_South_Pasadena that was a really tasty !
