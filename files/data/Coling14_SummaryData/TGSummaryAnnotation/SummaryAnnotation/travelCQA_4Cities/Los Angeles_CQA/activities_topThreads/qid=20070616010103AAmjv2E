Well , my girlfriend and I -LRB- age 17 and 19 -RRB- are planning to go to ENTITY_LA Sometime in July and we were just wondering what can we do there ? Time : arrive there early morning 6-7-8-9 am -- > back home at 11pm . We dont know ENTITY_L.A. quite well , so somewhere far from Lax airport might not work . . I heard the ENTITY_Santa monica and ENTITY_Venice beach or something like that sounds great . . ANy more suggestion and detail will be appreciated . Thanks

And I do n't think two teen-agers would much enjoy the Getty . Either do the beach thing , ENTITY_Venice in the AM , ENTITY_SM in the PM -LRB- NOT the reverse ! -RRB- or carouse around ENTITY_Hollywood . Either would appeal to you and are are close enough and do-able in such a short amount of time Plan to visit again when you can stay longer and spend more money .

Nice grounds , good view , since it 's on a hill , various art exhibits , cafeteria on the grounds . Museum is free , parking about $ 10 ; probably accessable by ENTITY_Metro bus also .

qid=20070616010103AAmjv2E_answer_7	2	qid=20070616010103AAmjv2E	2007-06-16 14:43:18 +0000	answer	 ENTITY_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_Lot 's of stores selling ENTITY_Hollywood memorabilia , people in costume wandeing around , Manns Chinese Theater -LRB- where the stars put their handprints in the cement -RRB- , it 's a site . You certainly wou n't want to spend all day there . Oh , the ENTITY_Kodak_Theater -LRB- where the Academy Awards and American Idol finale is held -RRB- is just down the street . ENTITY_Santa_Monica/Venice_Beach_Santa_Monica_Pier has rides and amuzements . Board walk for roller blading and biking . Lots of little bars and restaurants . Close by is 3rd Street Promenade , a pedetrian only road with shopping , cafes , bookstores , a mall and more . ENTITY_Beverly_Hills Fun to wander around and window shop . Good people watching ENTITY_Getty_Center_Museum_Beautiful place to view art , the west side , dine and take in some culture . Spectacular place . I would do this . Go to ENTITY_Getty_Center first . It is closer to the Airport then the other places I have mentioned . Towards noon , head to the Walk of Fame or ENTITY_Beverly_Hills . It may be hard to do both . At 2:00 or so , head to ENTITY_Venice_Beach , wander around towards ENTITY_Santa_Monica . Rollerblade or Bike -LRB- If you are n't interested in the freak show at ENTITY_Venice , you could get ENTITY_Venice or ENTITY_Santa_Monica a little later and spend more time in ENTITY_Hollywood - ENTITY_Venice quiets down in the late afternoon -RRB- . Go to third street promenade -LRB- it is 3 blocks from the beach and pier -RRB- to shop maybe grab a coffee and snack . Back to the beach and watch the sunset , then to the pier or back to third street , until you have to get back to the airport .
