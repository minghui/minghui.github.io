ENTITY_Santa_Monica_! The beach is amazing , the pier is wonderful -LRB- the rollercoaster , ferris wheel , ENTITY_Bubba_Gump -RRB- , and you have to go on the Promenade ! The shops are really fun and there are always live acts going on . You 'll be lucky if you catch ENTITY_Chelsea_Williams . Her vocal chords are golden ! Shop or Window Shop in Rodeo Drive -LRB- and maybe see a celebrity -RRB- . Eat at In-N-Out burger -LRB- you can find one anywhere -RRB- and uWink -LRB- 2nd story of ENTITY_Hollywood_&_Highland mall -RRB- . See if there are any movie premieres going on . You could stand by and watch the stars walk across the red carpet . Go see ENTITY_Paramount_Pictures_and_Universal_Studios ... and speaking of ENTITY_Universal_Studios ... As far as theme parks go , I see it like this ; If you 're in ENTITY_Hollywood , you might as well go to Universal . It 's all about movie magic . The rides are phenomenal and you can go on the studio tour as well where you 'll learn a lot about movies , experience special effects , tour sets , and just have fun . The theme park itself really makes you feel like you 're in movie land . Of course ENTITY_Disney gets the # 1 destination spot because of the name but I would rather save ENTITY_Disney for ENTITY_Orlando -LRB- it 's better there . -RRB- Good luck & & have fun !
