There 's more to do , the accommodations are at least equal to anything ENTITY_Catalina has , and cheaper , and the weather is more likely to be better . There 's nothing that ENTITY_Catalina has that ENTITY_San_Diego ca n't offer , and for less money . I think it is a far more beautiful place , too .

Basically you can see , and do everything on ENTITY_Catalina in one day . It 's a nice day trip when you 're visiting the ENTITY_Los_Angeles area . Couples that want to get away for a quiet , relaxing weekend often stay for a couple days , but most visitors do n't . There just is n't that much there .

I do n't know what it is like to stay overnight , but making a day trip out there was pretty fun . My family and I did an island tour of the place and learned a lot about the city of ENTITY_Avalon . I heard you can do like a `` safari '' type tour but it is pretty pricey . You can take the ENTITY_Catalina Flyer from ENTITY_Newport_Beach -LRB- that 's what I did -RRB- . But you can also take it from the ENTITY_Long_Beach area if you are closer to ENTITY_LA. . The weather was also pretty nice and warm for that time of year .

Go to VisitCatalinaIsland.com There 's lots restaraunts , shops , & activities . Either make it a day trip or stay for a few days .
