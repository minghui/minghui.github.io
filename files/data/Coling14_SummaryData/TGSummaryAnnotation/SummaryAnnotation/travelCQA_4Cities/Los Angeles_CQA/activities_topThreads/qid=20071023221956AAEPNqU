Maybe go to the Getty Art Museum . It 's high on a hill and you get a great view of te surrounding area and I think it would be very clear -LRB- for ENTITY_L.A. anyways -RRB- in December . ENTITY_Disneyland -LRB- depending on how old you are -RRB- in ENTITY_Orange_County . Perhaps see the stars names on the sidewalks -LRB- not too exciting -RRB- , ENTITY_Universal_Studios theme park , olvera street in downtown ENTITY_l.a. . Or maybe ENTITY_Sea_World , or the San Diego Zoo if you do n't mind driving . Or just go shopping .

But usually , ENTITY_LA is a place known for : - Amusement parks -LRB- Six Flags ENTITY_Magic_Mountain , ENTITY_Disneyland , Universal Studio -RRB- - Shopping -LRB- Rodeo Drive ENTITY_Beverly_Hills , ENTITY_Southcoast_Plaza_Mall -RRB- - Food -LRB- wonderful food from all ethnicity/type , my fave is Matsuhisa Japanese Restaurant by famous Jap chef ENTITY_Nobu -RRB- - The beach -LRB- ENTITY_Malibu , ENTITY_San_Diego , ENTITY_Santa_Monica -RRB- 4 days would n't be enough to cover all of ENTITY_LA , but if you can get a taste of the above list , then that 's pretty good .

You 'll know what i 'm talking about if you see huge group of people in the middle of the sand and hear the drums . Of course stay clear of some of the crazies out there . Other then that you have ENTITY_Disneyland , ENTITY_Hollywood -LRB- although not something very fun if you 've lived here I guess ... but lots of people love it there -RRB- , I would suggest a few other places but because of the fires your out of luck for some interesting places . ENTITY_LACMA is doing a ENTITY_Salvador_Dali thing till January I believe ... I have n't gotten to go there but I want to ! ENTITY_Pasadena has some cool shops on ENTITY_Colorado Blvd -LRB- Melrose in hollywood is good too -RRB- . Hope it helps ! Good luck !

If you liked the beaches , we have good beaches -LRB- Malibu/Santa ENTITY_Monica -RRB- . If you have a family , there are some good amusement parks -LRB- Disney/Univieral Studios -RRB- . If you like museums , we have some of the best in the world -LRB- Getty/LACMA -RRB- . Are you looking for excitement like dancing and clubs , go to Hollywood/West ENTITY_Hollywood pretty much any night . If you like the City feel , maybe ENTITY_Pasadena or Downtown LA/Koreatown . If you like nature , go to ENTITY_Huntington_Library . If you like wine tasting/country driving , drive up the coast to ENTITY_Santa_Barbara/Solvang .
