Money , transportation , areas , hotels , beaches , etc. . So many things to cover , and it all depends on you , your resources , your age , your interests ... Maybe you could go to websites dealing with ENTITY_California tourism . You 'll find overviews of the entire state there . Also you could go to a bookstore and look at a ENTITY_California guidebook , which will cover the whole state . You could also look at the Lonely Planet website . It will have good information .

There of course can be hazards rooming with a bunch of strangers , but many people safely stay in hostels . A motel in a touristy area close to stuff to do will be from about $ 100 to $ 200 a night , and that 's not for anything fancy . ENTITY_Google : hostel , ENTITY_Los_Angeles http://www.hostelz.com http://www.hostels.com At 19 , unless you 're a really social type , or the kind that people always talk to , it will take some effort to meet people . There are n't many club opportunities at that age , and music venues are generally so loud , it 's hard to speak to people . That 's why you may want to look into hostels to help meet people . You 'll want to check out ENTITY_Santa_Monica_Beach and Pier , and ENTITY_Venice_Beach and ENTITY_Boardwalk , they 're right next to each other .

Get an LA tour book to help you decide what you want to see . Good luck !

Hotels have age restrictions and they do n't allow people under the age of 18 to check in without an adult over the age of 21 along . You have to be 25 years old to rent a car too . Here 's a website where you can check out travel plans , flights , hotels . www.tripadvisor.com Here 's a website with information about visiting ENTITY_L.A. www.discoverlosangeles.com

You can go to ENTITY_tripadvisor.com to check out hotels and airfares . Average hotel prices are about $ 150 in summer , but you will have to find hotels that will let you check in , since you are under Food is about $ 30 - $ 50 per day . Car rental , if you can get it , is about $ 50 per day . See some of my other answers for places to hang out . I do n't have enough room to post that information along with this .
