I 'm from the ENTITY_East_Coast -LRB- ENTITY_PA -RRB- and this will be my first time visiting ENTITY_L.A. I will be flying into LAX by myself on Sunday afternoon around 5pm , renting a car and staying at a hotel -LRB- yet to be chosen -RRB- for the night until my friends arrive the next afternoon in ENTITY_Thousand_Oaks . I need something to do for the first night and next day to really put me in the spirit of the vacation . Any suggestions ? I want to save the really touristy things until my friends get here .
qid=1006051321888_answer_1	1	qid=1006051321888	2006-05-16 11:45:54	best_answer	 That 's a pretty hard question . Depends on the weather I would say . I would say check ENTITY_Venice_Beach one of the nicer beaches in the area ... and Lots to see -LRB- people watching -RRB- but if shoppings you thing Melrose Ave would be a cool place to go . But if you want to do the tourist thing Hollywood Blvd would be cool too Again it pretty much depends on what you think is fun because ENTITY_LA has a lot to choose from whether it be Olvera Street for Mexican or going to Club Avalon or ENTITY_Spundea @ Circus for some good music .

Awesome outdoor type `` mall '' with lots of entertaining street vendors and music . You may also see a celebrity or two incognito . The next day if your into the ocean , go to the ENTITY_Santa_Monica_Pier for a bit , then head a little south to ENTITY_Venice . Hot chicks , buff guys , and lots of interesting vendors/people . If that 's not your thing , go over to ENTITY_Hollywood_Blvd. . Find a cheap place to park and go look at all the Stars on the Walk of Fame . Also hit ENTITY_Mann 's Chinese Theater as well . I would also prefer to go to ENTITY_Universal_City -LRB- maybe 10 min . from WOF -RRB- to ENTITY_Universal_Studios . You do n't have to actually go to the theme park , but go to the City Walk outside of the Park . Lots of cool stores and restaraunts . ENTITY_L.A. in certain areas is a awesome town with lots to do . Have Fun .
