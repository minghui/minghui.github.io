They have a honeymoon suite , although obviously that 's not the room I stayed in . It is just so nice , and it took 2 minutes to walk down to the beach . There are lots of shops to walk around and see , and it 's 10 minutes from ENTITY_LAX . If you can afford it , I would definitely recommend it . I even told my boyfriend that we should come here if we get married and have a honeymoon . http://www.shadehotel.com/ There is even a bar on top of the hotel , called the ENTITY_Skydeck , and we were able to watch the most beautiful sunset I have ever seen in my life over the ocean . This is the nicest place I have ever been in my life , and I am just dying to go back .

I would recommend being by the ocean - ENTITY_Santa_Monica or even in ENTITY_Malibu ! Everywhere is easily reached by car - you have to drive EVERYWHERE in ENTITY_LA. . The traffic is a nightmare , but it is a great experience . We loved ENTITY_Santa_Monica_&_Malibu - beautiful . In ENTITY_Santa_Monica , if you get a hotel on the ocean front , you can walk to so many places on an evening , go to the pier -LRB- great fun -RRB- and watch the beautiful sunsets ! Congrats & have an amazing time . By the way - do the ENTITY_Warner_Bros tour !! It was amazing - 100 times better than ENTITY_Disney_&_Universal -LRB- although they were fab too -RRB- !!

THey are beautiful , have wonderful hotels , and are centrally located . Chinese Theatre is OK to visit . As for ENTITY_Hollywood itself , forget it . You will see for yourself when you get there . Spend a little time just walking on Rodeo Drive in ENTITY_Beverly_Hills . You will see movie stars easily . Also consider a tour of the ENTITY_Star 's homes in ENTITY_Beverly_Hills . Worth the time . Rent a car there if you can . It 's also worth it . Get a GPS if you want , but the city is really easy to get around in .

I hope you speak Spanish -LRB- so you can eat -RRB- , have much patience -LRB- for the unruly traffic and rude drivers -RRB- and bring oxygen . But if you must go to the places you mentioned , I recommend choosing ENTITY_West_Hollywood , ENTITY_Beverly_Hills or ENTITY_Brentwood . THose locations will permit you to access all except ENTITY_Disneyland - which is about an hour -LRB- or five hours , depending on traffic -RRB- to the ENTITY_South .

If you are staying for a week , go to disneyland and ENTITY_Universal_Studios during a weekday , it might still be packed since it will be during the summer , but less than what it would be during weekends . The Chinese Theatre and ENTITY_Hollywood_Blvd can be done in a day . LA is not that bad , of course stay away from ENTITY_South_Central and Downtown , but that 's about it .
