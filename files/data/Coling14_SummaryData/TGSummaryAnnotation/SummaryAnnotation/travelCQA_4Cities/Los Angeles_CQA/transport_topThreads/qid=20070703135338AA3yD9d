Downtown LA is not like other cities such as ENTITY_New_York . Downtown LA is basically High Rise Office buildings with not a lot of tourist places , as compared to other areas of LA such as ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , ENTITY_Beverly_Hills . You might want to see where you will be spending more time at and getting a hotel in that area .

The traffic is tough around ENTITY_LAX , there is really nothing to do in that area other than other hotels , not an area to walk around at all . Downtown would give you more choices and depending on where you chose , it could be far more fun to stay downtown that at ENTITY_LAX .

LAX is closest to the 405 -LRB- ENTITY_San_Diego Fwy -RRB- which is a nightmare . It could take you longer than an hour at the wrong time of the day . Traffic on that freeway is a nightmare and it could take you a lot longer than 20 minutes . Navigating in downtown LA is not easy at all with the traffic . I agree with the guy that suggests you stay in the downtown area . The LAX hotels are good for overnighting at the airport . Bad area for sightseeing for sure . If there are more than one of you in a car , you can use the car pool lanes but even the car pool lanes are stop and go near ENTITY_LAX . Some of the heaviest traffic in ENTITY_Los_Angeles .

Go on Saturday the 21st and it should be better traffic wise . I take the 405 north from ENTITY_LAX to the 10 east straight to downtown ... I know there is a slightly shorter way but I do n't want a broken down car in the ghetto ... and neither does a wandering tourist ... Your on vacation so you do n't need to worry about rush hours .

Yes it is simple to navigate but there are tons of one way streets . I would suggest staying in the more touristy areas of ENTITY_LA. . i.e. ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Anaheim . etc. .
