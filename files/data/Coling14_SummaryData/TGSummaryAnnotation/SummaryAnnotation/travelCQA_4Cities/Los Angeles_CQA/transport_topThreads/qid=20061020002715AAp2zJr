Im from ENTITY_Malaysia , going to ENTITY_Disneyland , ENTITY_CA on this Nov. . The problem is I afraid to book online those hotels near ENTITY_Disneyland as my credit card is ENTITY_Asian 's ones . I heard that , when I reach LAX , I can just choose any hotel from the hotel list on the wall -LRB- not sure which part of LAX -RRB- . I did surf in internet for hotels near ENTITY_Anaheim and have had choose one as my target hotel to stay - Super 8 Motel at ENTITY_Katella Ave. Then I heard about ENTITY_Disneyland_Express_Shuttle and decided to take that Shuttle to go to my target motel . I didnt book any room yet and will not doing so . I think I would like to just walk-in . Can anyone comment on my plan . Is it OK to do these ??

The last time I went to ENTITY_Disneyland -LRB- it was in April -RRB- , I was able to get a room just by walking in . A lot of hotels do offer airport shuttles . When you get to LAX call the hotel -LRB- s -RRB- you are interested in , inquire about vacancies , and ask them to send a shuttle .

I am from ENTITY_California and rooms tend to go a bit quick out here . But look online , find the cheapest hotel and book it . Most hotels have a shuttle to the park .

I do know about a shuttle from the ENTITY_Orlando CA airport . I would definitely suggest reserving a room . Foreign credit cards work in the ENTITY_US just as well as domestic ones . I 'd hate to see you schlepping your suitcases up and down ENTITY_Harbor or ENTITY_Katella trying to find a place to stay if the rooms were all booked up - it would cut into your park time ! And there are shuttles that take you from your hotel/motel to the park .

According to ENTITY_Yahoo , $ 44 a night is possible at many hotels on ENTITY_Harbor right next to ENTITY_Disneyland . Click on the target dots for prices .

It is probably easy to find a motel once you get there , but you may not like what you get . I would try for the ENTITY_Marriott or one of the more known hotel chains and see if you can find a good deal . We found one a few years back at the ENTITY_Marriott and it did n't cost any more than the Super 8 types .

But this time of yr you might be able to chance it . But then your coming from far away so I would book a room .

The hotels tend to charge more when you are booking at the last minute . They will try to charge full price when you are booking in their lobby . Try any travel websites such as ENTITY_orbitz.com or ENTITY_travelocity.com .

So if you are planning on coming around November 23 including the weekend , I would suggest you book ahead . I have never heard about the LAX hotel list , but then again I am from ENTITY_LA so I dont need a hotel . Many hotels around disneyland do offer shuttle services . If you are just planning to sleep in the motel then motel 8 would be fine . But if you want to enjoy your stay with a delicious room service breakfast/lunch/dinner then a hotel would be better . But then again , you will be here for ENTITY_Disney not the hotel . ENTITY_Anaheim does have ghetto -LRB- bad/ugly -RRB- areas so stay as close to ENTITY_Disneyland as possible . I would suggest saving $ on the motel/hotel rathert than splurging , because ENTITY_Disneyland is pricey and that 's not including the tickets .
