We are staying at hollywood/highland area and have a concert to go to in downtown LA -LRB- Orpheum theater -RRB- on the first night . As we are not renting a car while there , I was wondering if it 'd be safe to use public transportation late at night ? I was told that it is not recommended to walk in downtown LA at night time . The concert starts at 9pm so I think it 'd be done at around 11 or after . I checked that the metro would still be running at that time , and we would need to take a short walk to the nearest station to get on the red line , which seems to be convenient . Is public transit reliable at this hour or should we be calling a cab instead ? Thanks !

A cab from H&H to downtown would be expensive and there is always traffic on the 101 even at that time of night . The ENTITY_Red_Line is fast , cheap , and reliable and well lit and there are always sheriff 's and metro security patrolling the stations and cars . The Broadway area in downtown late at night can be a little scary but it just looks bad . There are many homeless people who sleep on the street there late at night but they tend to keep to themselves . And if you are walking with someone then you should be fine , just stay in well lit areas . I spent a week working up in ENTITY_LA on their rail system and would get off work around 11pm at night and my hotel was in downtown LA. . I did some walking around late at night there and although I was somewhat scared at first b/c it is so quiet at night , it really was n't dangerous . The homeless and crackheads tend to keep to themeselves or keep talking to whatever imaginary person they are when you walk by . I was also riding the trains till about 11pm at night for a week straight and it was not bad or dangerous . Take the subway , you 'll save $ $ and get there quicker than by cab .
