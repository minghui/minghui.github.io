I went last week and it was made it much easier to get through a lot of rides since you can do the ones that get busy early when there are no people there . -LRB- Space mountain was wide open - it was awesome ! -RRB-

But then you have to figure if staying off sight means renting a car , paying for parking , gas for back and forth , wasted time or inconvenience , etc. . . you may look at it at the end of the day and realize you did not save as much as you thought you did , and you missed out on all the convenience and perks you could have had staying at a ENTITY_Disney resort which is generally higher quality . So figure out not just the cost of a room off-site , but the cost of all the travel & parking & gas , and remember you will spend more time of your vacation in transit than if you stayed at ENTITY_Disney . Then look at the difference and decide if it would really be worth it . You have to check the prices for the ENTITY_Disney hotel on their website .

These go for about 80 to 100 dollars a night . But if you’re looking at other hotels in the area I like http://www.easyvoyage.co.uk/hotels/comparison since it gives you a lot of options . But the benefit of staying in ENTITY_Disney hotel would mean that you’re closer to the parks and could get there earlier in the morning than other people if that’s something you like .

The suites are considerably more expensive . You can check out the ENTITY_Disneyland website for their `` good neighbor '' hotels . These are nice hotels very near the park which are more reasonably priced . All of them have free shuttle service to/from the park . They also have package deals available on the website . www.disneyland.com This is a site that has tips and ideas on how to save money while visiting ENTITY_Disneyland . www.mousesavers.com The travel websites have ENTITY_Disneyland travel/hotel/park packages available . The only one I 'm really familiar with is : www.tripadvisor.com

When we went we stayed at a different hotel , got up SUPER early so we could get a good parking place at disney land . It all depends on how much you want to spend . We also packed lunches and walked outside the park to havelunch then went back in . ENTITY_Best bet would be to call disney hotel and ask about their packages . Just get a quote . Good luck and have fun !!! I do n't know if they have space mountain anymore but that was my favorite ride as a kid . . of course this has been twleve years ago !! lol hope this helps !
