They should tell you clearly how they will handle the charge before you commit . In my experience , they usually charge the whole thing , but it may be a day or two before it is posted . And often , if we must cancel a stay , we can get all but the first night 's charge refunded if we cancel early enough .

Most hotels offer a variety of rates , and this includes ENTITY_Hilton_Hotels , which have a variety of payment requirements . In some cases the card is just used to guarantee your reservation and it will not be charged until you actually check in while in others you are required to prepay so your card will be charged immediately -LRB- and often it is non-refundable -RRB- Speaking specifically regarding ENTITY_HIlton -LRB- although it can vary depending on the hotel -RRB- , they offer several rates , some of which require immediate payment , and others that simply use the card to guarantee the room . If you book a room at an Advance Purchase Rate you will generally save money however in this case your credit card will be charged immediately and , of course , the funds are non-refundable . Rooms booked at regular rates or even ENTITY_Best_Available_Rates require a card to guarantee the reservation however it is not charged until you actually check in/out .

I hope this helps . : -RRB-

Get the name of the person you are speaking to and the time and the date . Some hotels are company owned and have the same policy , but some are franchises and some are simply company operated -LRB- but not owned -RRB- ... so policies may vary ...
