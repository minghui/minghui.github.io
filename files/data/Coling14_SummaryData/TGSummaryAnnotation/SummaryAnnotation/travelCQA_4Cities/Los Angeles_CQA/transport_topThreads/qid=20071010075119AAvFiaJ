Just walk out the door and you will find it . . With luggage , that is about the best way . . Flayaway and subway is cheaper but too complicated for a noob with luggage . .

Since I 'm just chillin ' , waiting for Mobile Mark to post his most excellent answers , I 'll post a fill-in : There are two ways I can think of : Take Primetime -LRB- red van -RRB- or Super Shuttle -LRB- blue van -RRB- , or take the flyaway to Union Station , then the ENTITY_Red_Line to ENTITY_Universal_City . Of these , the shuttle is your safest option . If you have an advanced degree in math and can predict traffic , you can figure out how much a taxi will cost : Taxi RATES $ 2.65 â€“â Flag drop -LRB- first 1/11 mile or 30 secs . or fraction thereof -RRB- $ .35 â€“â Each additional 1/7 mile or part $ .35 â€“â Each 47.5 sec . waiting time and/or traffic delay -LRB- $ 26.53 / hr . wait -RRB- . $ 2.50 â€“â Airport-mandated surcharge for taxi trips originating at ENTITY_LAX $ 42.00 â€“â Flat rate per trip -LRB- group -RRB- in either direction for trips between LAX and Downtown Area bounded by ENTITY_Alameda_St. , ENTITY_Santa_Monica_Fwy. , ENTITY_Harbor_Fwy. , and ENTITY_Ceasar_Chavez Ave. , Plus Union Station , and ENTITY_Chinatown -RRB- . Distance is about 20 miles . As you say , it would cost bomb . The LAX to Union Station Flyaway is $ 4 . Buses run every 15 minutes . Commute time is 35-60 minutes . Look for the green Flyaway sign on the lower level bus medians . This is the cheapest way and most direct way to get to Union Station . However , a noob hauling luggage makes a pretty tempting target in downtown LA. . I certainly would n't do it , just because I would n't want to be hauling that luggage around . Shuttle Vans : Two shared ride van companies , ENTITY_Prime_Time_Shuttle and ENTITY_SuperShuttle , operate out of ENTITY_LAX and are authorized to serve all ENTITY_Southern_California counties . Passengers are encouraged to contact the companies first for more information . These vans pick up passengers on the Lower/Arrival Level islands in front of each terminal under the orange sign Shared Ride Vans . Might cost $ 20 - $ 30 , but worth it .
