Renting a car certainly will make a huge difference for you and your friend for making your trip way worthwhile . Too bad youre not renting a car :-LRB- Otherwise , take the ENTITY_Amtrak but its may be pricy : - / Good luck !

Our mass transit system here is not very good and you will literally spend hours and have to change buses/trains many times to do what you want . You will literally waste your time sitting in traffic . Spend the extra money to take a cab or rent an economy car for like $ 20 a day . If you plan well , like plan all the ENTITY_Hollywood stuff together , all the ENTITY_Anaheim stuff together , and all the beach stuff together , you can minimize your cab costs . I just hate to see you ruin your vacation by wasting all your time . This city is not like ENTITY_NYC or ENTITY_Toronto where your idea of using the trains/buses would be a good one .

That would be your best option . See metrolinktrains.com As you can tell , people in ENTITY_LA are biased against public transportation of any kind . In some parts it 's not so good , but the red line is frequent and efficient , and parking in that area is a pain anyway . ENTITY_Metrolink is cool too , just make sure you arrive 10-15 minutes before the train comes , since the trains are not that frequent .

We would love to . If we had one that worked and did n't get hours to get from one place to another . The only transit that works are the train lines but that does not work either because once your off that train you have to take a bus or something else to get to where you need to go . We have no choice , but to use our cars . Do n't waste your precious time while your here . Rent a cheap car .
