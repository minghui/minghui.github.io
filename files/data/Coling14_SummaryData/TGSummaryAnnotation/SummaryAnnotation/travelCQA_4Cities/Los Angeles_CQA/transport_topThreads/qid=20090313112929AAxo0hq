TImes 2.25 = about $ 75 . $ 30 per night to park at the hotel ? You 're at the wrong hotel ! ENTITY_Disney 's only $ 11 per day , ENTITY_Universal 's $ 12 , and those are some of the most expensive . Taxi : In addition to 2.65 to start , it 's about 2.45 per mile . So , if it 's 36 miles from ENTITY_Disneyland to ENTITY_Unversal , for example , that will be about $ 104.00 one way , plus tip . There 's also a rate for sitting in traffic . I estimate a taxi will be about $ 1400 .

ENTITY_LA is a car type city but most places you 'll go you can probably see by cab or by the fine subway . Go to a Laker game !

Public transportation in ENTITY_LA is only good in certain areas , and cabs are far more expensive than ENTITY_New_York or ENTITY_San_Francisco . Plan it out carefully .

As well , for a city this size , ENTITY_LA does not have a lot of cabs and when you phone for one , it can take 3 hours for it to show up . And note that ENTITY_LA is so spread out that you can easily spend $ 100 a day on cab rides . Before I lived here , I would just rent a car . Considering that a vacation costs $ 250 a day anyway , the difference in cost between a car rental and cabs is pretty well non-existent . Besides , how are you going to do the # 1 tourist thing which is cruising . The cruise down Sunset from the 101 to the ocean itself is a major tourist thing to do .

qid=20090313112929AAxo0hq_answer_9	2	qid=20090313112929AAxo0hq	2009-03-13 18:52:11 +0000	answer	 I just returned from ENTITY_LA 2 weeks ago and we decided to take public transportation . Depending on where you are going and if you 're not in a rush it is ok - but I suggest that you stop at the visitor 's center first and get a paper map since the online metro site is HORRIBLE . We took the ENTITY_Santa_Monica bus from our hotel to the Getty -LRB- it was the scenic route and a decent ride -RRB- . Our taxi trip from the hotel -LRB- which was near the airport -RRB- to the Convention Center cost $ 60 ! That 's what you would pay for a taxi ride ENTITY_Newark_Airport from ENTITY_Queens - highway robbery . If you really want a car at your disposal and are n't traveling for a few weeks consider signing up for ENTITY_Zipcar so you can rent a car for a few hours instead of full days - you may save that way . Have a great trip .
