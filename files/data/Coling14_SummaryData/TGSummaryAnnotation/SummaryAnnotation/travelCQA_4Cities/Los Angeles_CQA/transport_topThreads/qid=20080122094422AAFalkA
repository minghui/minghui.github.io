I dont mind making the 10-15 minute drive to disneyland since we will have a vehicle . Which motel or hotel do you guys recommend ? A decent one .

Your better off just paying the little bit extra . I was also looking for hotel in that area of disneyland and found some great prices . I recommend staying at close distance to disneyland . Good Luck !

I also suggest the BW Park Place Inn and Suites or any of the others on Harbor Blvd that are in your price range . Hope that helps !

It will save you 11 dlls for parking ... and on busy days , it can take up to 30 minutes from the time you enter the parking lot to get to the Park Entrance , especially if you are sent over to a lot that has no shuttle service -LRB- you 'll have to walk all the way to the park -RRB- ... And even on quiet days , it takes a while to enter the parking lot , get to your space -LRB- the Cast Members tell you where to park -RRB- , walk to the shuttle stop , wait for the shuttle , board the shuttle , get to the park and walk to the entrance ... Not to mention that it 's safer than 3 miles away from ENTITY_Disneyland ... I 've stayed on several hotels on the Resort Area , but if you want cheap but nice , I personally recommend the ENTITY_LA_QUINTA_INN_&_SUITES_ANAHEIM or the TRAVELODGE ENTITY_ANAHEIM ... they 're both a block away from ENTITY_Disneyland , so you wo n't get all the hastle from around the resort , but you can still walk there ... and they can be between $ 80 and $ 120 per night , depending on when you go ... Have Fun !

They all have shuttles . Parking at disneyland is $ 12 and a HUGE walk and wait .

It 's very tricky getting `` cheaper '' hotels . Take a trip to ENTITY_tripadvisor.com and read some of the reviews . A couple places to avoid are the Park View Inn on West Drive , and a couple of hotels called ENTITY_Best_Value_Inn and ENTITY_America 's ENTITY_Best_Value . When you figure how much your time is worth , you 'll see it 's a pretty good value to stay close to the park . Some days it takes an hour to drive to the structure , park the car -LRB- after waiting in line -RRB- , wait in line for the shuttle , take the shuttle to the front of the park , and then wait in line again . -LRB- We are passholders and live about 15 minutes away -RRB- .

ENTITY_Google_Anaheim or ENTITY_Buena_Park . There are lots of affordable places to stay . Maybe ENTITY_Costa_Mesa would be good & that 's about 15 mins away from ENTITY_Disneyland_& also near ENTITY_Newport_Beach which is a nice area .

Sometimes people do n't realize what a pain in the ass getting your car ... which can be 3 miles away and going back to the hotel a couple times a day , if you have small children , can be .
