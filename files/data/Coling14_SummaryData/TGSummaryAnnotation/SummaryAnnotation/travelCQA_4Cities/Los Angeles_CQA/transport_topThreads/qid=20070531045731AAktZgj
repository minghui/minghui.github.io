The Mexican government does not recognize any insurance as valid unless it is written by a ENTITY_Mexican company . ENTITY_Mexico also operates under the Napoleonic code which says you are presumed guilty in matters of law and you must prove your innocence . Additional : You can walk across the border to ENTITY_Tijuana , or you can take the `` Mexicoach '' from the border crossing parking lot . Please do a ENTITY_Yahoo search of `` Tijuana Transportation '' . Click on the first entry -LRB- ENTITY_Tijuana_Transportation -- Getting around ENTITY_Tijuana by bus-taxi-foot -RRB- , and this sight will give you `` tons '' of information about your visit to ENTITY_Mexico . Your question was not dumb , I apologize for not including this extra information originally .

You may not be able to take a rental car in . You can park at the ENTITY_US border and take a taxi in . It 's cheap and it 's only about a mile . Do n't drink the water , do n't get arrested and do n't go anywhere alone .

Just use the light rail system popularlly known as the SD Trolley . It travels between several stations in the ENTITY_San_Diego area -LRB- including downtown -RRB- directly to the boarder for about $ 3 each way . The system connects to many other destinations as well . Generally service hours on the main lines are from about 5 ENTITY_AM until Midnight . Plus , if you decide to make a day of it coming from ENTITY_LA consider using ENTITY_Amtrak from ENTITY_LA_Union_Station to ENTITY_Downtown_SD . The fares are reasonable , the service fast & frequent and the ride is really cool ! There are also ENTITY_Metrolink_&_Coaster commuter trains that make the trip between ENTITY_LA_&_SD for even less cost if the timing is right . Good luck !

I would suggest parking in ENTITY_Downtown_San_Diego and taking the Blue Line to the border . Then you can take a cab into TJ and you wo n't have to worry about getting Mexican insurance . There seems to be some confusion on the passport requirement . Currently , a passport is required to enter a foreign country if you travel in the air or by sea . You can still cross the border by land w/o a passport until Jan 1 , 2008 .

You will have a fun day , just be careful . Do not drive water take bottled water with you . And try not to eat their food . It can make you sick .

There are some excellent answers here , allow me to tack on a few notes : You can park on the ENTITY_San_Ysidro -LRB- ENTITY_US -RRB- side of the border and walk across . Also , you can park anywhere in ENTITY_San_Diego along the red trolley line , which takes you right TO the border -LRB- I mean within a few feet of it -RRB- . How about taking ENTITY_Amtrak to ENTITY_San_Diego , grab lunch at Tony 's , then take the Red Car Trolley to the border ? No driving needed . -LRB- You do n't want to take your car , or a rental , into ENTITY_Mexico . In fact , your rental car agreement should say that you ca n't take it into ENTITY_Mexico at all -RRB- . You can walk to the shops on ENTITY_Avenida_de_Revolucion , it 's not that far . Or you can negotiate a ride with the cab drivers at the border . Set a FIRM price ahead of time , or you could have a big problem at the end of the ride . Hang tough , and you could work them down . DO N'T accept their first offer . If you do n't like the offer , see another cabbie . Watch the offer come down immediately . You do n't need a passport until 2008 , if you are walking or driving . Be careful . Have fun .
