We are coming to ENTITY_LA in March -LRB- From ENTITY_Australia -RRB- Our flight home does n't leave until 10.35 pm but we have to check out of the hotel at 10am . My question is are we able to checkout , go to the airport and check our bags in or would it be too early ? -LRB- We are staying at ENTITY_Disneyland while in the ENTITY_US and transfers are included from LAX to ENTITY_Anaheim and back again when we leave -RRB- Also what transport would be available from the airport to take us back into ENTITY_LA to kill time before our flight leaves ? And how much would it cost ? Can you do a lot of sight seeing on foot in ENTITY_LA or do you need transportation to get to a lot of places ? What 's the weather like there in March ? Thanks in advance !

All of the `` Good Neighbor '' hotels around the resort offer the service mentioned already : Holding your bags , presumably while you are visiting the park one last time . Contact your hotel to see if tney offer it . If not , maybe you should change your hotel . If you opt for storing your bags at ENTITY_LAX , the airline might let you check in early , but you should call . If not , then there is a service that stores baggage : http://laxluggagestorage.com/ Prices depend on the siz and number of bags . If you want to go to ENTITY_LA for sightseeing , take the `` Flyaway '' bus to Union Station . Cost is $ 7 . You can do some limited sightseeing , especially if you take the Red Line Subway : - Union Station : Olvera Street , ENTITY_Phillippe 's for a beef sandwich , ENTITY_Chinatown -7 th Street/Metro : ENTITY_Staples_Center , ENTITY_LA Live/Nokia Theater , The Pantry , Grammy Museum , ENTITY_ESPN_Zone - ENTITY_Hollywood_&_Highland : H&H Complex , ENTITY_Kodak_Theater , Chinese Theater , Walk of Fame , ENTITY_El_Capitan_Theater - Universal City : ENTITY_Universal_Studios_and_City_Walk_Cost is $ 1.50 per ride , or get a day pass for $ 6 . Weather is very mild in March . Average high is 73 , average low is 59 .

I would suggest you stay in ENTITY_Anaheim that day . There is lots of shopping -LRB- downtown ENTITY_Disney -RRB- available . There is shuttle service available from LAX to ENTITY_Anaheim - just inquire at the hotel . Most airlines will not let you check in bags more than a few hours in advance .

You can rent a day room at one of the hotels near the airport and store your luggage and go to the airport and get a shuttle to take you whereever you would like to go . ENTITY_SuperShuttle ...

The hotel will typically allow you to stay longer , if you ask in advance . = sometimes for free ; you can always pay for another night . You need to contact the airline to determine what is the earliest you can check your bag . It 's about 45-50 minutes from ENTITY_Anaheim to ENTITY_LAX . It 's nearly impossible to get around ENTITY_LA on foot . There is some public transportation but it only goes where it goes and difficult to use if it 's not going where you want to go . You can figure out how to get there , it just might add on hours to the journey . LAX is near - ENTITY_Marina_Del Rey/Venice Beach , ENTITY_Manhattan_Beach , and sort of close to ENTITY_Santa_Monica

I would look at this site - figure out some options and see if it is closer to get to them from your hotel than from the airport . It would be early to check your bags - in the old days they would send them off on the first flight but now they make sure that bag and passenger are on the same flight so they would be held somewhere and you stand the risk of them not getting on your plane . http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/
