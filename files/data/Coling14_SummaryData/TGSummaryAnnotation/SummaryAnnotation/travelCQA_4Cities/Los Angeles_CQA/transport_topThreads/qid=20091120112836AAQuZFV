I 'm leaving town for Thanksgiving and I 've been having difficulties figuring out where I should park my car during this time . I 'll be leaving Monday and returning the following Friday . I ca n't park outside of my apartment because I 'll get a ticket . And I do n't want to leave my car at the airport if I can help it , because I do n't have much money to spare . Where in ENTITY_Los_Angeles could I get away with leaving my car for five days without paying or getting a ticket ? Any help would be greatly appreciated , thanks .

Try one of the Park and Ride lots , and take public transportation to the airport . You would eventually have to use the Green Line to the Aviation Street Station then use the free `` G '' shuttle to the airport . Just a thought .

Here 's another idea : Park your car where you normally do . Have a friend in the apartment , or maybe the manager , just move it forward or backward every other day . They only go by chalk on the tire to determine if you are garaging your vehicle on the street . A ENTITY_San_Diego police officer told me to do this many years ago when I had a seriously ill vehicle . It worked great . I finally got the car fixed and running about five months later . Also , does anyone remember that ENTITY_George performed the same service on Seinfeld for the other tenants in his apartment building ?

If I were you I 'd pay to use park and fly or just have a friend drive you and park the car at his place and let him move it once when street cleaning happens , but if you do n't want to do that ... There 's a residential neighborhood behind the ENTITY_YMCA which is located on 83rd and ENTITY_Sepulveda that has no street cleaning on some of the streets . You need to check signs . You could park your car there but you do risk it getting broken into .

You might try LAX Park -LRB- http://www.laxparkandfly.com -RRB- ; their rates are really cheap -LRB- $ 5-6 / day -RRB- and their shuttles are fast . I just used them and was very happy with it especially given the price .

Anyways park your car either at ENTITY_Wal-mart or ENTITY_Sam_'s_Club , especially Wal-mart since it 's open 24/7 . Many big trucks are parked there overnight .

Do n't you have friends or relatives ? Anyone ? Because ENTITY_Los_Angeles has a 72-hour limit on parking in one spot . Enforcement of said law depends on where you live ; some areas are much more ticket-happy than others . I 'm guessing you do n't have a spot in your apartment . Your options seem to be rather limited , and support what we always say here : ENTITY_LA is very expensive , and people here have a casual indifference . - Park in a friend or relative 's property . - Find a street with no parking restrictions and lax enforcement , and hope your car is n't stolen or vandalized . This is a virtual impossibility on the west side , because of the ENTITY_Parking_Gestapo , and in many other areas because of crime . - Park on private property , such as a ENTITY_Wal-Mart or shopping mall . However , a car there for 5 days will most certainly be noticed , and either ticketed , towed , or vandalized . Sorry , it looks like you are either going to have to pay to park , or take your chances .
