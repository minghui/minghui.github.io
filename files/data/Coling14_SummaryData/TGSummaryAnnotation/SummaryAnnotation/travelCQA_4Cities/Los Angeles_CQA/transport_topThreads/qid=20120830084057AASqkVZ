If you 're at least 23 -LRB- the minimum age to avoid an `` under age surcharge -RRB- you will find renting a car MUCH cheaper , and make your travels so much easier .

But the exact policy will vary so it is best to contact the Rental Company at ENTITY_LAX directly . Do not use the Toll-Free number , as that often goes to a central call center where they may not have the exact requirements for the specific location . You really have to decide on where you will be going as to if a taxi would truly be the most economical way to travel . For example if one of the places you went to was ENTITY_Disneyland you are looking at about an 80 mile round trip depending on exactly where in the valley you are . At your rate of $ 30 every 7 miles you would be looking at about a $ 350 in taxi fare . Although for this you could use cheaper shuttle services , but still expect anywhere from $ 100 - $ 200 + . If you stay around the Valley and going to places such as Universal you can use ENTITY_Public_Transportation , it wo n't be as fast but it will be a lot cheaper . If you do go the taxi route , it wo n't be hard to find one . It is not like ENTITY_New_York or other big cities where you can just step to any curb wave your hand and have a taxi pull over . But if you are at a major hotel or tourist destination there will often be a taxi stand where there will be taxi 's waiting . In places where there is not a taxi you can call and one will usually be there within minutes .

We do n't really flag down taxis in ENTITY_LA , there was a law against it , although things are changing . There are designated taxi stands throughout the city , and you can always call a taxi company and a taxi will show up usually in about 15 minutes . There are shuttle buses to take you to attractions , usually pick up is at hotels -LRB- you do n't have to be staying there -RRB- , or ENTITY_LAX . ENTITY_Google : Shuttle to ENTITY_Disneyland , or wherever Rental cars are a good option if you feel ok about driving in ENTITY_LA , look into renting from your location online as often there will be better prices than renting in ENTITY_LA. . Our public transportation is n't the best , but it 's ok for a visitor if you plan well . We have limited light rail and subway , it works really well , it would be convenient to take from ENTITY_Universal_Studios_/_City_Walk into ENTITY_Hollywood to do the touristy stuff if you want to , or to downtown LA to see things like Olvera St , ENTITY_Chinatown , ENTITY_Little_Tokyo . Public Transportation : ENTITY_Google_Maps , map locations , and choose the little bus icon for public transportation info Trip Planner @ www.metro.net Good luck !

Keep in mind that public transit could take a very long time . Why not just go with your friends ? Or at least ask THEM how to get where you want to go .

I do n't know about getting between your friends and the park . Can they drive you ?
