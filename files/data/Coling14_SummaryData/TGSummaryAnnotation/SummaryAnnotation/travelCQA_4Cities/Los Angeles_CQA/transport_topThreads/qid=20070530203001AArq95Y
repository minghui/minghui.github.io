qid=20070530203001AArq95Y_answer_1	1	qid=20070530203001AArq95Y	2007-05-31 05:04:47 +0000	best_answer	 I work at ENTITY_LAX . The other answer is wrong . The ENTITY_Best_Western in ENTITY_Anaheim will NOT provide a shuttle . Its too far . But in front of each Terminal , lower arrival level , when you go outside you will see colored signs overhead . Go to the ENTITY_Orange overhead sign . Those are the airport shuttles . There are two companies . ENTITY_Supershuttle and Primetime Shuttle . Just give them the address and they will get you there . There are dispatchers right there under the orange sign . ENTITY_Supershuttle person has a blue jacket and the primetime person has a red and black jacket . They are located at every terminal . There is also a big ENTITY_Disneyland Bus that runs every 1/2 hour and leaves from under the Green overhead sign . They stop at ; most hotels , check with the driver.Both are very close in price . The most expensive is a taxi . Good Luck ps if you need more info email me : kingsleydr60@yahoo.com

But you still are better off taking the freeway , because there 's no way to easily keep you out of bad neighborhoods . 1 -RRB- Exit LAX and take the 105 Fwy EAST 2 -RRB- Stay on it until you get to the 605 NORTH . 3 -RRB- Take the 5 FWY Exit ... it will say `` ENTITY_Los_Angeles / ENTITY_Santa_Ana '' Stay in the lane marked for ENTITY_Santa_Ana , which is SOUTH . 4 -RRB- Take the 5 SOUTH to Exit 109B for ENTITY_Disney Way 5 -RRB- Turn Right at ENTITY_Disney_Way and go to Harbor Blvd 6 -RRB- Turn right on Harbor Blvd *** If you hear that the 5 Freeway is very bad or backed up forever -LRB- which is usually is between 3pm and 7pm -RRB- , you could also do the following : Same exits out of LAX to the 105 EAST . This time once you 're on the 105 EAST take the 605 ENTITY_SOUTH . Stay towards the right and get on the 91 FWY EAST -LRB- towards Riverside -RRB- Stay on the 91 EAST until you get to the 57 FWY Take the 57 FWY SOUTH towards ENTITY_Santa_Ana_Exit at ENTITY_Katella_Avenue_Turn right at E Katella Ave Turn right at Harbor Blvd *** If you have driven out here before , remember that a lot of Freeway signs often wo n't mention directionals , they 'll mention the city at the end of the freeway . From where you 're coming , ENTITY_Santa_Ana will be ENTITY_South .

If you are not renting a car , your best option is one of the `` shuttle '' services . A taxi would be prohibitively expensive , and I 'm sure you will get directions on how to go by `` public transportation '' . Forget that ! You do n't really want to transfer from bus to bus to bus with a lot of luggage .

If you intend to rent a car during your stay use enterprise . They pick you up and they are much cheaper since they do not have their offices on airports . This cuts out the airport tax , which really is a lot in ENTITY_CA . Bon Voyage !

Oh I forgot all the while toting around luggage -- sheessssch .

That might be quicker than the ENTITY_Disney bus , which will eventually stop at ENTITY_BW_Stovall_'s . If you rent a car , take the 105 to the 5 south . If it 's crowded , just stick it out . The alternate routes are n't going to be much better , if at all . - Exit ENTITY_Disneyland_Drive , not ENTITY_Disney_Way . - Turn right on ENTITY_Disneyland_Dr. Stay to the right , otherwise you will go into the ENTITY_Mickey and Friends Parking structure . - ENTITY_Stovall 's is on the corner of ENTITY_Katella and ENTITY_Disneyland_Drive , which turns into West St at ENTITY_Katella . ENTITY_Cross_Katella , then turn right just past the coffee shop , into the parking lot of ENTITY_Stovall 's . Have fun !

This bus is a bargain compared to the Super Shuttle style vans unless at least 3 are traveling . The ENTITY_Disneyland Â® Resort Express Reservations 2001 S.
