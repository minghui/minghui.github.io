You have two choices , equally difficult because the routes are used by commuters : Take the 405 south through the ENTITY_Sepulveda_Pass -LRB- along with several hundred thousand of your closest friends - and they WILL be close -RRB- . Continue on the 405 past the airport , then east on the 105 to the 605 south . Go about a mile or two , then east on the 91 all the way to the 5 south . It 's only a couple more miles to ENTITY_Disneyland Drive exit . Other route , might be a bit quicker because it 's shorter : Take 101 east -LRB- crowded here -RRB- , stay to the left and take the 134 east to the 5 south . -LRB- The 101 south takes you into the heart of downtown , and you do n't want any of that -RRB- . The 5 south skirts downtown , but it will still be pretty bad until about ENTITY_Commerce . Stay to the left as soon as you get on the 5 , because you will still need to make a transition in the ENTITY_East_LA_Interchange . Stay on the 5 another 25 miles or so , exit ENTITY_Disneyland_Drive . On ENTITY_Disneyland_Drive , stay to the left to take the bypass ramp past ENTITY_Ball_Rd. . Once you are in the `` Theme Park Only '' lanes , as you approach the structure , you will have numerous lanes to choose from . Try to get as far to the right as possible . For some reason , the right-most lanes go fastest . Watch out for closed lanes , though . Buy your park tickets in advance . It saves tons of time . Have you thought about staying at the HoJo ENTITY_Anaheim ? It 's a nice hotel , right across the street from the park . It will save you 60-90 minutes of driving , which really makes a difference when you are going to the Happiest -LRB- and most tiring -RRB- place on ENTITY_Earth . Trust me , I see folks leaving the park all the time ... just BEAT . Happy , but VERY tired . A short walk across the street and a dip in the hot tub sure beats the drive back to ENTITY_Sherman_Oaks .

It will give you options for the fastest , or shortest route accompanied by a map . The freeway is still going to be your best bet . Have fun !

I guess I would bite the bullet and try the 405 ... or -- Go the night before and stay in ENTITY_Anaheim ???? -- or -LRB- just thinking out loud , -RRB- I wonder what ENTITY_PCH is like south of town that time of day ... -LRB- awwww it 's probably jammed too -RRB-

Here is the best way . Get on the south bound 101 . Travel on it all the way to the south bound 5 . exit ENTITY_Katela . There are signs that will tell you where to go . Even on the freeway itself there are signs . Traffic will be heavy in some places . Because it is rush hour . Why not leave earlier . 5:30 am is a good time to get on the mentioned freeways .
