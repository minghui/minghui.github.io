It seems like no one really bothers taking the metro , but lately I 've seen a lot of things online about the metro expanding all over ENTITY_LA. . So I 'm just wondering if the metro will ever be a way to get around the city to reduce having to deal with the cars and the traffic , therefor reducing smog etc etc. . Does anyone know ? Thanks !

'' when in reality , almost one in every ten people do -RRB- . I 've lived in ENTITY_Los_Angeles for 6 years , started taking the ENTITY_Metro and biking about three and a half years ago , and went completely car-less a little over a year ago . It does n't work for everyone , but I encourage everyone to at least try getting around without their car for just a day , or even just a weekend or an afternoon . A lot of people are content to say they do n't know how to get around on the ENTITY_Metro , and refuse to just explore . With tools like ENTITY_Google maps and other applications on smart phones incorporating rail and bus schedules , plus live GPS tracking on all Metro buses , taking the ENTITY_Metro got a lot more convenient . ENTITY_Metro has a long way to go to improve service -LRB- and if you follow some of the news and updates about the projects funded by Measure R and other improvements coming down the pipeline , you know they are certainly heading in the right direction -RRB- , but above all , I encourage people to just experiment with alternative ways of getting around . I know people who live by one subway station , work by another , and still drive to work . Or people who work a mile away from where they live , own a bike , but still drive because they 're just used to it . Or there are those who think they 're `` slumming '' when they ride a bus two miles . So , in short , yes , ENTITY_Metro will be a good means of transportation . For some , it might take a while for that to happen , but for others , it very well could already be if they just give it a shot .

It will take planning and time . ENTITY_L.A. has a car culture , but at sometime in the future cars may become too expensive for the average person . The price of cars rises each year , the price of gas rises each year , smog and pollution will only get worse as time passes . There was a time in the last century when the trolley/streetcar lines were a major means of transportation in ENTITY_L.A. . The freeways did away with those and a car culture came into being . Nothing is permanent , and it 's very possible that legislation or some unforeseen event could bring back mass public transportation . In many major cities , for instance ENTITY_New_York and ENTITY_Paris , people do n't even think about owning a car -- only the very wealthy have cars ----- the average ENTITY_Joe or ENTITY_Jill walks to the subway station to get from one place to another . In some cities the residents bicycle to a subway station . It 's sounds impossible for ENTITY_L.A. right now but everything changes .

They do the best job they can with what they have to work with . I ca n't fault them for that . If you only need to travel a relatively short distance they can offer an affordable way to travel . Go a long distance , and you 'll spend most of your time just traveling . The problem with most public transportation systems is that bus/train/subway routes tend to be set up in a grid pattern running in straight lines . If you need to travel in any other direction than a straight line you have to change buses/trains/subways to get where you want to go , and those transfers can often be very time consuming . Most people would rather drive a car because it 's quicker , and more convenient .

No , because you often still need to drive or take a bus to a metro station . Some of the stations are in odd places , like the Gold line in ENTITY_Pasadena , some are inconvenient - the Gold line does n't go to where the tall buildings are downtown , one has to transfer , and the new Expo line coming up from ENTITY_USC does n't go all the way to Union Station , or to the beach . We 're so used to our cars , the trains would have to be really convenient to get us to use them .
