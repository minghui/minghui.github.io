Do some sight seeing , maybe the beach around ENTITY_Santa_Monica , or one of those silly ENTITY_Hollywood tours . From LAX you can take a `` Flyaway '' bus to ENTITY_Los_Angeles_Union_Station , fare is $ 4.00 , and runs late into the night.Then a short taxi ride to Greyhound . It 's about a mile . The Greyhound station is in a very bad area of downtown ENTITY_L.A. , do n't go roaming around in this part of town after dark . Once you go to the terminal stay inside . Have fun on your trip to ENTITY_Flagstaff . By the way . You can also get to ENTITY_Flagstaff , ENTITY_Arizona on ENTITY_Amtrak -LRB- rail -RRB- cheaper than going by bus . Greyhound shows a fare if $ 70.50 each way , ENTITY_Amtrak shows a fare of $ 59.00 . ENTITY_Amtrak also leaves earlier , at 6:45 pm on the 12th . The train will also be DRAMATICALLY more comfortable than the bus , and since the `` Flyaway '' takes you to Union Station , why not ?

The area around the Greyhound is NOT where you want to be at 12:35 . All the pimps and thugs hang around there . Once you get to Union Station on the Flyaway , you 're golden . You can take the Red Line Subway to ENTITY_Hollywood -LRB- visit the ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland complex , ENTITY_Walk of Fame , Chinese Theater , and El Capitan Theater -RRB- , or to ENTITY_Universal_City -LRB- visit ENTITY_Universal_City_Walk or a quick tour of ENTITY_Universal_Studios -RRB- . Or you could walk across the Street to Olvera Street or have a sandwich at ENTITY_Phillippe_'s . Have fun !

Suggest you fly to ENTITY_Phoenix , either directly or from ENTITY_LAX , then proceed from there . Please please take my advice .
qid=20081029084910AALWiAJ_answer_7	2	qid=20081029084910AALWiAJ	2008-10-29 20:31:12	answer	 I think 13.25 means 1:25 PM arrival so that is around 11 hrs . From LAX to get to Greyhound you can take a bus or a shuttle . The shuttle is the easiest . When you arrive and have all of your luggage , go outside to the Orange overhead sign . Those are the shuttles . Primetime and Super Shuttle . Dispatchers are right there to help you . Cost is roughly 20ish dollars . You can take a Bus too . From LAX go to the Blue overhead sign and take `` C '' shuttle to the bus depot that is right outside the airport . Take ENTITY_Metro 42 to 7th St. Get off at ENTITY_7th_&_Decatur and walk back to the Greyhound station at 1716 E. 7th St. Its about $ 1.25 . I think they have lockers at the Bus Depot and then you can walk around downtown and have lunch and do a little shopping . Just be aware of people and be careful . Do not walk around ENTITY_LA after dark , stay in the bus depot . Anymore questions ? kingsleydr60@yahoo.com ENTITY_PS . do not let strangers approach you and engage you in conversation . They may not be friendly .

We live here and there is no way any of us would be caught wandering around the Greyhound Station at 1:00 in the morning . It 's like Drug Central ... That 's just asking for trouble .
