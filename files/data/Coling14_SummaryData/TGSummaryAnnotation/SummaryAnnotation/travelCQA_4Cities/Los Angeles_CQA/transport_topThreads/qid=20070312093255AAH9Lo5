In ENTITY_LA for a week next month and would n't mind seeing ENTITY_San_Francisco . Only want to go for a day so anyone know the best way ? Are there any cheap flights as driving is obviously too long for just a day ?
qid=20070312093255AAH9Lo5_answer_1	1	qid=20070312093255AAH9Lo5	2007-03-13 00:10:39 +0000	best_answer	 To make this journey in ONE day you must fly , every other method of travel will take too long . Lucky for you that the ENTITY_Los_Angeles - ENTITY_Bay_Area corridor is the most heavily traveled routes in the ENTITY_United_States . Every airline flies there , some even having hourly departures . The competition for your business is fierce . Any good travel consolidator -LRB- ENTITY_Orbitz , ENTITY_Travelosity , ect -RRB- can get you a great fare . Yes , ENTITY_Southwest_Airlines is very cheap , but they drastically over book this route , and you stand a good chance of getting bumped off the flight . In addition to flying to ENTITY_SFO , try pricing ENTITY_San_Jose , ENTITY_SJC , -LRB- 45 miles south -RRB- , and ENTITY_Oakland , ENTITY_OAK , -LRB- 12 miles east , although trying to cross the ENTITY_Bay_Bridge in the a.m. is a real bear -RRB- . Also consider taking a `` Red Eye '' flight up and staying that night in the bay , coming back the following night . Welcome to ENTITY_California , and enjoy your visit . CAUTION : I apologize if this sounds like a racist remark , but it tends to be true . In downtown ENTITY_San_Francisco , some ENTITY_Asian drivers tend to run red lights . Be careful crossing at intersections .

You 're right ... driving is way too long . . it would take you the day driving just to get there . The train is n't much faster .

I live in the bay area and I would recommend that you see San Fran . Make sure you see ENTITY_Haight_&_Ashbury , Pier 39 , fishermans wharf , lombard St. , ENTITY_Alcatraz , and drive over the golden gate bridge . It 'll be one fun day .
qid=20070312093255AAH9Lo5_answer_6	2	qid=20070312093255AAH9Lo5	2007-03-12 17:15:51 +0000	answer	 First of all , we have to keep ENTITY_Torsten away from his crack pipe . Just going fro LA to ENTITY_Santa_Barbara via train takes 3 + hours , and LA to SF via train can take 12 hours or more , since FREIGHT traffic takes precedence . Go figure . -LRB- However , I HIGHLY recommend the train trip from ENTITY_LA to SB for a nice day trip . -RRB- As you noted , driving is a bit much , considering the distance -LRB- over 400 miles -RRB- . Even if you go up I-5 and cut over at 580 , it 's still a good 7-8 hour drive , although I once did it in under 6 . That 's still a lot of driving for a one-day . The good news is that ENTITY_Southwest has some cheap flights , about $ 44 each way . However , they do n't fly into ENTITY_SFO , but ENTITY_Oakland instead . But it 's really no big deal , you can take a shuttle bus to the BART station , then take the ENTITY_BART under the bay and into downtoan SF in a few minutes . I 've done it , and both my daughters -LRB- ages 23 & 20 -RRB- have done this as well . You can get off in the Union Plaza area , then either take a cable car to the waterfront , or just walk the 2 miles . -LRB- Sometimes the line for the ENTITY_CC is just too long . My daughters did this a couple months ago as well . It 's a bit of a hike , but there are a lot of cool neighborhoods you see : Market St , ENTITY_Chinatown , ENTITY_Little_Italy , and ENTITY_North_Beach -RRB- . Have fun !
