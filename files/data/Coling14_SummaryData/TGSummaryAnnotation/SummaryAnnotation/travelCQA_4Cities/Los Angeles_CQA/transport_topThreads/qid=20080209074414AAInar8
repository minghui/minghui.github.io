qid=20080209074414AAInar8_answer_1	1	qid=20080209074414AAInar8	2008-02-10 10:41:37 +0000	best_answer	 I saw in your other post that you are coming from ENTITY_London . It depends upon what time of day you arrive -LRB- most flights from ENTITY_Heathrow arrive after 2pm -RRB- , and the time it takes you to clear ENTITY_US Customs . If your flight arrives at 3p , you get your luggage and clear Customs by 4p ... then get your shuttle van by 4:15 ... you will be heading south in rush-hour traffic and possibly making stops if there are other people riding in the van , so probably not arriving until after 6p if you 're lucky . If you 're set on ENTITY_Laguna as your destination , fly ENTITY_United or American out of ENTITY_Heathrow and connect to ENTITY_SNA -LRB- ENTITY_John_Wayne-Orange_County_Airport -RRB- . OR , fly ENTITY_Delta out of ENTITY_Gatwick and connect to ENTITY_SNA from ENTITY_Atlanta or ENTITY_Cincinnati . MUCH easier . If you land at ENTITY_Orange_County , you 'll have a fast drive to ENTITY_Laguna . Once in your vehicle , it 's a 20 minute drive or less . Most of the nearby hotels offer shuttles . Taxi service is easy at ENTITY_John_Wayne airport . I agree with some of the previous people , there 's only so much to do in ENTITY_Laguna , unless you specifically want to stay there and there only . Or , are able to be in one of the newer resort hotels in ENTITY_South_Laguna that offers endless things to do . You could get a hotel in ENTITY_Newport_Beach or ENTITY_Huntington_Beach and drive or take the bus down ENTITY_Pacific_Coast_Highway to ENTITY_Laguna . Or , you could stay in ENTITY_Laguna for a couple nights and then check out another area of southern Ca . Be sure to visit ENTITY_South_Coast_Plaza for shopping in nearby ENTITY_Costa_Mesa . You 'll find that eating out is cheaper than it is in ENTITY_London , that 's for sure . -LRB- Except for dining in hotel restaurants , where it can be over-priced ! -RRB- Many of the same fast food chains you have in ENTITY_London -LRB- Burger King , ENTITY_KFC , ENTITY_McDonalds -RRB- and lots of Mexican chains .

From ENTITY_John_Wayne_Airport , ENTITY_Laguna_Beach is about 20 - 25 mins away , hopefully there will be no traffic because the 405 freeway is always busy . Have fun in ENTITY_Laguna_Beach . Its very beautiful there !!!

It should cost around $ 70 to get from LAX to ENTITY_Laguna , depending on how many people are in your party . It 's about 45 miles , so it can take from 1-2 hours , depending on traffic . If it 's possible to fly into Orange County/John ENTITY_Wayne -LRB- ENTITY_SNA -RRB- , it would be much faster to get to ENTITY_Laguna .
