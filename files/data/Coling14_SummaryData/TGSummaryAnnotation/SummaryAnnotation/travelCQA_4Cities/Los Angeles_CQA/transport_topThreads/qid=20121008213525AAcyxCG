I was thinking of moving out there , but the subway does n't even go to ENTITY_West_Hollywood or ENTITY_UCLA area . That does n't seem very helpful . It is not like the Subway in NY ?
qid=20121008213525AAcyxCG_answer_1	1	qid=20121008213525AAcyxCG	2012-10-11 08:56:11 +0000	best_answer	 Yes , people DO use/rely on the subway in ENTITY_LA , as well as the bus system . Is it convenient ? Well , that depends on where you live , work , and go to school . For example , if you lived in ENTITY_Hollywood , went to ENTITY_USC , and worked in ENTITY_Pasadena , you 'd be golden . But , if you lived in ENTITY_Torrance , went to ENTITY_UCLA , and worked in ENTITY_Santa_Monica , you 'd better get a car or be prepared to spend a lot of time on the bus . No , it 's not like the NY subway system . It is n't nearly as extensive , and most of it is n't even a `` sub `` way , so to speak . Other than downtown and the red line going into ENTITY_Hollywood , most of it is above ground . If you are planning to move here and rely on public transportation , you should plan accordingly . Go to the ENTITY_Metro website and look at route maps . Look for apartments and jobs that are near train stations , because , while the trains are fairly clean and safe , I have personally found the buses to be beyond gross .

The ENTITY_Metro light rail/subway is very limited in ENTITY_LA , and ENTITY_LA is very huge . If you live right near a ENTITY_Metro light rail/subway station , and your work or school is near a station , then it 's convenient , especially if you do n't have to change trains . Otherwise , you may never use it , and our buses tend to be slow , and often there are long wait times for transfers , and the buses do n't run nearly as often as they did when I was a kid . They take a lot of time overall if you 're going any distance or need to transfer . As much as I love the convenience of the NYC subway , after recently driving there for the first time , I 'll take LA and cars only . -LRB- I was shocked at the people walking in the middle of the packed street , in the friggin ' bus lane too , when the sidewalks were not full , and now they have a campaign to stop it . Very weird phenomenon . -RRB- Good luck !

Back when I used to live near the Red Line I used to go to ENTITY_Little_Tokyo 3 times a week . Now I moved and getting to ENTITY_Little_Tokyo is a pain to go do to slow buses . My BIKE is faster than waiting for a bus . Getting to ENTITY_UCLA is the 720 rapid from the ENTITY_Purple_Line or Red Line -LRB- Get off at Vermont/Wilshire -RRB- at ENTITY_Wilshire which takes 30 minutes if I remember .

ENTITY_LA is earthquake country -- the subways are underground . . think on this for a minute Subways are better in NYC than in ENTITY_LA. . The less you have to be riding around in closed quarters with the riff raff of ENTITY_LA. . the safer you will be . Get a car .

ENTITY_Los_Angeles is GIGANTIC . You can walk across NYC in a couple of hours . You can walk across the ENTITY_Greater_LA area in about a week .

The system in ENTITY_L.A. is limited , it does n't cover the entire city . Many people use it daily , it 's clean and efficient , but very few rely on it for all transportation needs . You will actually need to have a car in order to get around the city . Here is the website for the ENTITY_L.A. bus/subway system with maps , routes , schedules . www.mta.net
