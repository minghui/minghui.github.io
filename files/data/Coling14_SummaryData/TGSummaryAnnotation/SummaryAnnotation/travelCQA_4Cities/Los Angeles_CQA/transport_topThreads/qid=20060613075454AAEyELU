I have just found my brother after thirty two years , I live in WV and he lives in ENTITY_LA. . He is going to be on vacation in August and wants me , my husband , and two children to fly out there so he can meet us and take the kids to ENTITY_Disneyland . It 's going to cost $ 2500 with hotel , car , air , and tickets to ENTITY_Disney . That 's a really good deal , but I can not have the money immediately to pay in advance without borrowing it . I have terrible credit and do n't want to apply for a bunch of loans and be declined to make my score worse . I need ideas and fast . I am about two months out from when we would fly out .

In tight times we have done them and even though you pay alot in interest , if the trip is that important to you and you make enough to borrow that much , then that may be the way to go . You can pay it back over weeks and weeks if you need to . Just an idea , though not the best one . But hey , if you want more info on it I use a nice company on the net and I 'd get a referal fee and I think you 'd get money too ... just a thought ! Good luck , hope it works out for you . That really is a good deal on the trip !

The ENTITY_Disney area is not very big , so if you were to stay at the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson 's , you can get a good deal on mousesavers.com . You do n't need tickets to the park for the entire visit . There 's a lot of things to do in the downtown Disney area . Sure , its not the theme park , but if you wish to save money , that will help . If you take the super shuttle from the airport to the hotel , its about $ 15 per person . From the ENTITY_Disney area , skip renting a car , and rent one only on the weekends . Enterprise sometimes have weekend specials , and they will also pick up from the hotel to their rental office . I would also go to a travel agent and see if he/she can come up with the cheapest combination for airfare . You do n't want to wait unti the last minute to get the airfare either . Try going to a credit union and see what other options you have to get money . There 's not a lot of options if you do not have the money right now , except to borrow .
