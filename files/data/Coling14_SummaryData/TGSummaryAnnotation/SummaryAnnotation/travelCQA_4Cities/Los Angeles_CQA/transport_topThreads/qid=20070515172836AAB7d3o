You can do a search for ENTITY_Metro_Los_Angeles on your search line . I work for ENTITY_Travelers_Aid at ENTITY_Los_Angeles_International_Airport . Every terminal has a ENTITY_Travelers_Aid booth . Go to one of them and they can help you . They have bus schedules , maps and brochures . Also most hotels have brochures of fun things to do . You can also travel by ENTITY_Amtrak train if you go to , say like , ENTITY_San_Diego . We have good buses and our ENTITY_Metro_Rail system go right to ENTITY_Universal_Studios and ENTITY_Hollywood . They have a stop right next to the Chinese Theater . The airport has buses and shuttles -LRB- Super Shuttle -RRB- available . Taxis are very expensive . You can take the buses and shuttles from the Airport to ENTITY_Disneyland and to almost anywhere you want to go . Cost varies . $ 15 to $ 40 is average depending where you want to go . Try and stay away from ENTITY_Downtown_Los_Angeles , It is yucky and the people are not very nice . ENTITY_Santa_Monica , ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Anaheim are nice places . You can email me if you need more info . I will be happy to help . kingsleydr60@yahoo.com

My honest opinion for ENTITY_L.A. is to rent a car . Avoid the freeways between 3:30 - 7:00 pm and 6:30 - 9:30 am . Depends on which way your heading . Ask at your hotel . They will know !

Sure , we have buses , taxis and trains , but they do n't take you everywhere and can be terribly inconvenient . If there is absolutely no way you can rent a car , my suggestions are : Call the hotels and see if they have any shuttle services . Check with the venues to see if they offer shuttles . I know , for instance , that ENTITY_Universal_Studios have a shuttle from ENTITY_Anaheim . Consider some of the tour companies , like ENTITY_Gray_Line . Consider renting bicycles , or even an electric , street-legal vehicle . Of course , you would need a driver 's license . There are even places you can rent Segeways and scooters . Put an ad on ENTITY_Craigslist to see if you can find someone who wants to earn a little extra pocket money playing taxi . ENTITY_LA without a car is do-able , if you coordinate . For example , do n't try to take a bus from ENTITY_Hollywood to ENTITY_Anaheim in the morning , then expect to get back to ENTITY_Hollywood that night . Plan on spending at least 2 day around ENTITY_Disneyland , to get a chance to the park without being rushed .

The area is so vast , and the attractions so far apart , that public transporation just is n't practical . This is not ENTITY_San_Francisco , where you can stay in the middle of town and be close to everything . The city of ENTITY_Los_Angeles is over 450 square miles , ten times the size of ENTITY_San_Francisco . Metropolitan LA is over 4500 square miles . It 's HUGE . For example , it 's a good 40 miles from ENTITY_Universal_Studios to ENTITY_Disneyland . The bus & metro system -LRB- at www.metro.net , by the way -RRB- , just can not get you there easily . Check out metro.net , and try to go between a few attractions , and you will see . Just rent a car while in ENTITY_LA. . In SF or Vegas you do n't need one , in ENTITY_LA you definitely do . Good luck

That 's why so many cars . Some area cities like ENTITY_Long_Beach , ENTITY_Torrence , ENTITY_Gardena , and much of ENTITY_Orange_County have fairly good systems , but do n't have or service many of the touristy attractions . You can log on to `` www.mta.net '' and get a map of the ENTITY_L.A. transportation , but is is very confusing . Look for your self . If you do use public transport you will spend most of your day transferring from bus to bus to bus to train to bus ad nauseum , and will have little time to do much else . Rent a car ! EVERYONE IS TELLING YOU THIS . PLEASE BELIEVE ENTITY_US .
