But , LAX is closest to all the activities you want to see . ENTITY_Universal_Studios is in ENTITY_Universal_City . I would look for something close to ENTITY_Burbank , any nice hotel chain . This will get you closer to your destination and the hotel wo n't be such a long drawn out drive to other spots you want to see . Traffic is your biggest concern . Try to get going early and stay late . ENTITY_Hollywood_Blvd is not far from ENTITY_Universal_Studios and it 's worth seeing . Avoid staying downtown or near the airport , as the noise level is extremely high . Have fun !!

Stay at the ENTITY_Hilton_Universal right next to Universal/City Walk . The subway is down at the bottom of the hill , and one stop south is ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland , which is where you want to go . So that is convenient . Take a cab from ENTITY_Hollywood/West_Hollywood area to Rodeo , it 's not too far , but not within walking distance -LRB- the bus might be a little too hard to figure out for a one shot deal -RRB- ... . Have Fun . .

qid=20071015082122AALYz7J_answer_7	2	qid=20071015082122AALYz7J	2007-10-15 15:58:13	answer	 Stick with ENTITY_Burbank or ENTITY_LAX . You 'll waste too much of your short time here just getting from the airport if you fly into ENTITY_Ontario or ENTITY_John_Wayne . ENTITY_Burbank is probably the closest but can be a bit more expensive to fly into . You may want to look into hotels in the ENTITY_Hollywood area - there are a few nice ones , such as the ENTITY_Roosevelt , and the Renaissance . You 'll be right in the thick of the best part of ENTITY_Hollywood for tourism . You 'll also be close to the ENTITY_Red_Line , ENTITY_LA 's subway . From there it 's a snap to get to ENTITY_Universal_Studios - 10 minutes on the train and it takes you literally across the street from ENTITY_Universal . One thing , though - the day pass , which is good on all trains and buses , is now 5 dollars , not 3 dollars . The price went up a few months ago . Still , not a bad deal . If you were there on Hollywood Blvd , say at ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland , it would be very easy to take the ENTITY_Red_Line to ENTITY_Wilshire and ENTITY_Vermont , then hop onto the 720 Rapid Bus going west . There 's a stop at ENTITY_Wilshire and and ENTITY_Beverly_Drive , which is about a two blocks from Rodeo Drive , and right there in all that fancy shopping area . There 's other ways too , but that 's the simplest . You can find lots of good public transit info at ENTITY_MTA website , below .
