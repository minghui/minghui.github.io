There are several routes serving the ENTITY_UCLA area including the 2 , 20 , 302 , 305 , 720 , 761 , 920 and with a ENTITY_Metro to ENTITY_Muni transfer you can also gain access to the ENTITY_Big_Blue_Bus_&_Culver city transit systems which also serve the area . This way you can have the freedom to hop on & off as needed while visiting apartments , save money on high cab fares & avoid parking hassles . Good Luck !

This site is way better than the rest because it lets you search by neighborhood , price range , amenities/utilites , convenience , and whatever else you want in an apartment . What 's even better is that if you do n't know a neighborhood well , hubbuzz gives detailed descriptions of what the neighborhoods are known/notorious for and a calendar of events and map of places in the area . Hope this helps !
