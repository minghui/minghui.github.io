However , taking a bus takes forever and taking a taxi costs an arm and a leg . Some places are not close at all . You 're going to have to study a map and see where you want to go and see if it has bus service . Renting a car is the best bet . I realize by driving you ca n't do a lot of looking around , but you could drive from one place to another , park and take the bus around your local area . Also a lot of places you may want to see wo n't have buses . http://www.la2day.com/travel/how_to_get_â€?http://www.metro.net/default.asp

Unfortunately , our old system was abandoned and not developed when it could have been kept up , so we are re-building , but MANY people depend on it , and they use it just fine . It is only the people who are stuck up who fail to use it to its potential -- their loss ! www.metro.net
