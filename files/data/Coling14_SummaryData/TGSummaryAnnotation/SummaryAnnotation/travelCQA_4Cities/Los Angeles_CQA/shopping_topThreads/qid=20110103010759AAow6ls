Not sure if I really want to move there for work from sf bay area because I 'm more introverted and earthy and I feel like I do n't fit in with the people I meet from the ENTITY_LA area . If you live there - what do you think of the area overall ?

Downtown LA is a growing community that gives a small time feel in the heart of the big city . It 's got plenty of health conscious restaurants and a variety of environmental cause groups . Plus , if you live in Downtown you can take the subway to a variety of places , while still expanding , is a great option . In addition , areas like ENTITY_Silverlake , ENTITY_Los_Feliz and Echo Park are all areas that are highly infused with a diverse arts and earth conscious scene . Just do your research a bit before you decide to move to ENTITY_LA as it does spread throughout large areas of ENTITY_Southern_California and many of the neighborhoods are very diverse and different from each other ! Good luck !

Its a polluted mess and it takes like an hour to go 5 miles in traffic . I have lived here all my life -LRB- im 17 -RRB- and I really dont feel like I fit in here . If you are more earthy and introverted , im sure you can find people like that here cause the city is so big , but in general most people are superficial and impressionable . Of course the weather is nice and it has some cool places but overall I do not like living here . I have many other states and can honestly say ENTITY_LA has the most stuck up people ever .

As far as introverted and earthy , we have lots of those types , we have all types . Maybe you 're just not meeting the right kind of people from ENTITY_LA. . Our job situation is bad right now , and it 's expensive , but depending on where you live now , it may be similar . If you have a good job offer in ENTITY_LA , chances are high you can find an apartment close enough to your work , and meet people similar to yourself . You 'll have to work a bit on looking to meet new friends , because by definition , introverted people are n't outgoing . Good luck !
