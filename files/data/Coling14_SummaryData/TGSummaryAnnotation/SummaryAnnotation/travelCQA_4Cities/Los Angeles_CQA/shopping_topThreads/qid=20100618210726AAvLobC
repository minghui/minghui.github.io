Yes , there is a ENTITY_China_Town . It 's just a couple blocks north of Union Station , but it 's mostly restaurants . The cheap knock off stuff is sold in an area called ENTITY_Santee_Alley . The closest intersection is ENTITY_Santee_Street and West 12th Street . It 's just a little ways east of Staples Center . You can look it up an a mapping website . If you will have transportation you can get name brand stuff somewhat cheaper at an Outlet Mall , but most are some distance out of ENTITY_L.A. . The best are ENTITY_Ontario_Mills , or ENTITY_Camarillo_Outlets

There 's also a ENTITY_Little_Japan and a ENTITY_Koreatown . You can usually find cheap knock-offs for sale all over the ENTITY_LA area . For cheap , you can shop at places like ENTITY_Ross or Target ... or head for the Fashion District south of the Civic Center . Yikes ! Shopping is great there !!! If you 're staying with someone local , they 'll know where to go . http://www.fashiondistrict.org/ http://lafashion.veplan.net/show.aspx?miâ€?There are super-rich areas and super-poor areas . It 's getting pretty third-world in some places around town . You should visit Rodeo Drive just for the experience . It 's really fun to window shop in ENTITY_BH but the most fun thing is looking at the people you 'll see shopping there . For some of them , the clothes they have on are worth more than all the clothes in my closet ... and probably my car .

We have a lot of fashion i go to school in downtown ENTITY_LA_Hollywood is the bomb its so much to do out here a lot of aspiring actors and actresses , so do n't quit your day job . ENTITY_China town is ok they have a nice american apparel but the clothes are not cheaper unless your a good thriftier . The downtown alleys are where the knock offs are.Rodeo Drive is in ENTITY_Beverly_Hills_LA is like ENTITY_New_York_City

We usually just go to Downtown , where we buy whatever stuff we need . Yepp , there 's cheap stuff . Bootleg movies , jewelry , perfumes , electronics . I saw a digital camera for $ 50 , and it would have sold easily for twice that much or more at a retail shop . Oh wait , you said IS THERE a ENTITY_China_Town . Well yes there is :-RRB- But I 've never been there . ... and like everyone else pointed out , it 's pretty ghetto , but it is cheap .
