It might be 66 degrees and foggy at the ocean and 100 degrees and sunny a few miles inland . Bring layering options . I grew up in ENTITY_NC and , when I moved here , quickly realized one often needs a sweater or jacket in the early morning and soon after the sun goes down .

Lingerie Pantyhose/socks PJs or nightgown ENTITY_Robe_Slippers_Cosmetics_Hairbrush/comb_Toothbrush_Swimsuit_Beach_cover-up_Beach_flip-flops_Sunglasses_Blue_jeans_Nice slacks T shirts Blouses/shirts Dress -LRB- sundress and/or one that can be worn out to dinner -RRB- Shorts Sandals Walking shoes Dress shoes -LRB- if going out -RRB- Hoodie/cardigan/light jacket Casual is almost always OK in ENTITY_Los_Angeles . Slacks and a T will do for most things For many things you 'll probably wear shorts with a T and , obviously swimwear at the beach or pool . A hoodie/cardigan/light jacket is always a good idea for the cooler nights . Good walking shoes are a must if you plan to visit any of the theme parks . For dress up events bring along a `` little black dress '' -LRB- it does n't have to be black ! -RRB- or , alternatively , black dressy slacks and a black silky top . Remember too , you can buy anything you 'd possibly need in ENTITY_L.A. , so do n't worry overly about forgetting an item or two . You can pick up sunscreen , sunglasses , make-up , toothpaste , etc. in any drugstore around the city .

But typical temps are around 85-90 degrees . Absolutely pack shorts , tshirts , and the beach wear . You may want a light jacket for the night as the temps can get down into the 40 's occasionally . Flip flops are a must for just about anyone who lives here ! ;-RRB- And summer is monsoon season here in the southwest -LRB- yes , southern ENTITY_Cali included ! -RRB- so you may have a hot , muggy , rainy day or two where a waterproof jacket or umbrella -LRB- or just your beach wear ! -RRB- might come in handy if you are out and about and a tstorm pops up !

I can not remember the last time it rained here in the summer ... if i recall it was something like 1992 , a freak thunderstorm rolled through . ... We do , however , get lots of morning , somewhat chilly , overcast skies near the coast , then the sun starts to break out around noon . You want a list , so I 'll just tell you what suits me best here in the summertime : Tank or strapless type sundresses -LRB- long and short -RRB- comfy flip flops shorts tank tops tennis shoes -LRB- if you 're walking long treks -RRB- socks a pair of jeans for nighttime sweatshirt/light jacket and sweat/yoga-type pants for night/early mornings bathing suit !!!! sunblock sunglasses sun hat -LRB- optional -RRB- hair bands jewelry maybe some higher heeled strappy sandals if you 're planning to go out to nice restaurant ... In ENTITY_LA , there are people that come from all walks of life . ... and since you mentioned you 're `` from ENTITY_Ohio if that helps '' , I wonder if you 're thinking that you wo n't fit in with your clothing , but do n't worry about that , people wear pretty much anything and everything out here ... this is a very ecclectic city and a melting pot of cultures -- the folks out here are young , old , rich , poor , kind-hearted , mean , or somewhere in between . ... have fun . p.s. since you 're visiting for two weeks , I 'd really recommend you also check out either ENTITY_San_Diego or ENTITY_Santa_Barbara ... both about 2.5 hour drive from the city of ENTITY_LA. ... both these cities are great ... ENTITY_San_Diego , we try to drive down there as often as we can ... it 's our home away from home .
