The 3rd Street Promenade in SM is n't a mall , but it 's hands down my fav place to shop here . There are so many awesome stores there , and it 's two blocks from the beach and just chilled out and fun . I also like ENTITY_The_Grove and ENTITY_Century_City . There is some mall in the ENTITY_Valley - I think it 's in ENTITY_Woodland_Hills - that is pretty sweet , but I do n't usually trek there . It 's HUGE and has everything from a ENTITY_Tiffanys to a Target ! It also has an indoor playground and about a billion stores . : -RRB-

I guess because it has that fabulous hollywood appeal . * Edit * That does n't mean that it is the best mall . 3rd Street Promenade in ENTITY_Santa_Monica ... I love the energy and people watching . The Grove is a little too snobbish for me . * Edit * All malls do NOT have to be enclosed to be considered a mall . The Grove is a mall , and so is ENTITY_Century_City , and the mall in ENTITY_Pasadena !

Having been to mostly all of them we personally liked the ENTITY_Glendale mall a lot and then the Beverly Center . We do of course love the ENTITY_Grove but it 's more like an outdoor shopping center .
