You 'll also want to bring : sunglasses and sunscreen moisturizer & facial cleanser a hat if you burn easily 13 year old girls here do n't wear a lot of make up except for at school dances , so some light colored gloss and maybe eyeliner -LRB- not black ! -RRB- , but that 's all you should need . Toiletries , but do n't bother with shampoo and conditioner , your aunt will have that , hair styling stuff , but pack it in your checked luggage , as there are rules about how much liquid you can bring on board the plane in your carry on . Ask your aunt if you need to bring a blow dryer , and bring any curling irons , etc that you usually use . Glasses and/or contacts , if you use them , do n't wear contacts on the plane if you 're flying more than a couple of hours , put solutions in checked luggage , but you 'd have to put contacts into the liquids bag -LRB- ask your mom -RRB- for security to check . Pack light , you can wash your clothes at your aunt 's so you do n't have to bring something different for each day , and you want to leave room to bring back souvenirs . You can buy most anything you need at Target , so if you forget something , it 's probably not a big deal . And of course , your cellphone and charger , a camera unless you only use your cellphone . Be sure in ENTITY_LA to carry around your aunt 's info and have an idea of where you 're going each day , just in the slight chance you get separated from her . Have fun !
