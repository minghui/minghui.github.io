The shops are between ENTITY_Fairfax and ENTITY_La_Brea . For boutiques , I 'd say ENTITY_Robertson between ENTITY_Beverly and 3rd Str . The 3rd Str Promenade in ENTITY_Santa_Monica is great too , but pretty much mall stores .

qid=1006060129733_answer_8	2	qid=1006060129733	2006-06-03 02:19:14 +0000	answer	 I would recommend The Grove , ENTITY_Beverly_Center , and ENTITY_Glendale_Galleria . The Grove is one of those outside shopping centers , and the whole scenery is kind of nice . They also have a nice theater , but not too many good stores to visit , in my opinion . They do have a big ENTITY_Barnes and ENTITY_Nobles though . ENTITY_Beverly_Center has more higher-end stuff . They , too , have a theater but they normally do n't play good movies , as in they 're either really old or you 've never heard of them . It 's not as crowded or popular as the other two I mentioned . ENTITY_Glendale_Galleria seems to be a popular hang out spot for a lot of teens , and a lot of the stores they have are n't as expensive as the others . It can get a bit crowded during the weekends , though . You can always check out their sites to check out the store directory . All three have websites .

Additionally , the shops along Melrose Avenue between ENTITY_La_Brea and ENTITY_Fairfax Avenues provide great up-to-the-minute fashions . For a cross-cultural shopping experience , try ENTITY_Chinatown in downtown LA -LRB- www.chinatownla.com -RRB- and Olvera Street -LRB- www.olvera-street.com -RRB- - they 're both within walking distance of each other and Union Station .

For teenagers , there 's a lot of malls to check out , ranging from ENTITY_Century_City , near ENTITY_UCLA , to Beverly Center , to the ENTITY_Grove to ENTITY_Beverly_Hills . Melrose has a lot of great shops too . If you want outlet style stores , the Citadel off the 5 freeway has a lot of stores . The Garment District in downtown LA has clothes , and once a month the designers discard their samples . Sometimes you can get a real bargain . I believe the place is called the ENTITY_Coopers building . You can try googling it .
