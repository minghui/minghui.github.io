You can not generalize . The greater ENTITY_LA metropolitan area is 90 miles across . Boggles the mind , eh ? Crime . Yes like any other major city in the world there is crime . So be alert . Do n't go down unlit dark alleys at night . And stay out of ENTITY_South_Central , ENTITY_Watts , and ENTITY_Compton . Otherwise have fun . Downtown LA is a lot of fun . Do n't be afraid . It 's been cleaned up . The Jewelry district is at 5th and Hope . Broadway is a huge shopping district . Under the office towers are more shops . And the Music Center is there for theatre and Concerts . Third and Grand is the outdoor concert theatre next to the ENTITY_Museum_of_Contemporary_Art . In the summer there 's lots to do there and its free . Olvera St is lots of fun to see an orginal sort of shopping street from the birth of ENTITY_LA. . ENTITY_Chinatown is great . ENTITY_Little_Tokyo is great . The Fashion District at Olympic and ENTITY_Santee is a gas with a whole bazaar like setting called `` The Alley '' . The ENTITY_California_Fashion_Mart there on Fridays sells off samples . The last Friday of the Month is a huge sample sale . Three giant buildings selling all sorts of apparel and housewares that wo n't be in the stores for 6 more months . There are plenty of guidebooks . Use one . The tourist places will be fine . Venture out and around . You will need a car . Enjoy a wonderful varied city with all the cultures of the world in one giant mega-city . Get a guide book . Read it . Figure out what you want to see . Just DON `` T go see the Watts Towers . DON `` T.

Stay out of ENTITY_Compton , ENTITY_Watts , ENTITY_Inglewood , and ENTITY_South_Central in general . Do n't stare at the gang members either - that 'll just cause them to have to `` pop a cap in yo a $ $ '' .

I 've lived here all my life and , while I would n't drive through Compton without a good reason , the only crimes I 've been a victim of have been car-related -LRB- having it broken into or stolen - NOT carjacked -RRB- . And the freeways are n't all bad all the time , just mostly bad most of the time . It 's true that you will be safe if you stay west of the 405 , but you do n't have to . After all , there are some very high income spots east of the 405 -LRB- ENTITY_Beverly_Hills , ENTITY_Century_City , ENTITY_Westwood , ENTITY_Bel_Air , etc. . -RRB-

For the most part anything west of Interstate 405 is fine . ENTITY_LA is no worse than other big cities - aside from traffic and smog . enjoy ENTITY_Malibu , ENTITY_Manhattan beach , ENTITY_west_Hollywood -LRB- Hollywood itself is nothing special -RRB- .
