Generally , the more nice parts of LA like ENTITY_Hollywood , Melrose street and west hollywood are more expensive . Today I went into a shop to buy boba -LRB- drink -RRB- in ENTITY_Hollywood for 5 dollars , when I can buy it for 2 dollars somewhere less fancy . Get it ? 2 . Yes , there is one in ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Citywalk , ENTITY_Glendale_Galleria , pretty much in every mall . 3 . I do n't know if you are referring to a specific wine or place , but there is a wine store in ENTITY_Hollywood called ENTITY_K&L Merchants on Vine street . ENTITY_Google it for an address . 4 . Most souvenir shops are in hollywood , everywhere check out Souvenirs of ENTITY_Hollywood on the corner of Hollywood/Highland it 's a big store with souvenirs but also other clothing etc. 5 . Good food is everywhere , from In N out to Pink 's and basically every mexican shop has good food haha . Laptops can run from 500 and up , an Xbox is about 250-300 with taxes and other accessories , good brand shoes are about 50 and up , and clothes and headphones vary price obviously . But you can find pretty cheap clothes in department stores . I bought a good pair of skullcandy earphones for 30 dollars , but there are some for 10-20 . Hope this helped !

If you live in a country which uses any other voltage and frequency of electrical current , any electronic equipment that you buy here WILL NOT WORK unless you have a transformer to change the voltage .
