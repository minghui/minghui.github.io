However , during the daytime it feels really nice . Make sure to bring a sweatshirt or coat and jeans , but you can also wear t shirts and shorts . Sometimes I even lay out on Christmas in my bathing suit . haha .

I 've seen guys wear shorts , flip flops and a hoody in the rain . Girls wear a tank top , mini shirt and knee high uggs in 32 degree windchill . We wo n't wear hats in the blazing sun , let alone use an umbrella when it rains . I get laughed at for wearing rain boots . We have no sense here . My best advise , layer . It rarely gets below 55 during the day , but it can get down right chilly at night . And ooccasionallyit even rains .
