Alot of fun things to do . The air has never made me sick . The streets are more safe now thanks to the new leaders , I see alot less gangs now , unlike 10 years ago . I do agree its not the cleanes city compare to other cities in the ENTITY_US . Oh one more thing stay out of Watts/South Central .

You CAN NOT get bored in ENTITY_LA ! This may help as a reference just in case . As of right now , because of the economy , a job opening in ENTITY_Los_Angeles is almost non existent . You will also need about $ 10,000 to start off . Decent prices start at $ 1000 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you 're lucky . There is no such thing as $ 750 mo. here . A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent . Remember , you need to eat , you need water , gas , electric , personal hygiene , etc. .

ENTITY_LA is a city of many races and cultures . Go with the flow and enjoy : -RRB-

ENTITY_LA can be crowded . Its hard to sleep at night will all the noise but you have to get used to it . Some parts of ENTITY_LA are nice and some places are not . Seeing the hills hollywood is nice . But a problem there is there are a lot of gangs . The average amount of people killed in 1 year is 26 people . So , lock your doors . There are lots of speeding cars in ENTITY_LA. . About 10 to 30 crashes in a day . LA is not as bad as ENTITY_New_york . I like ENTITY_New_york but some times it gets to crowded and it has a lot of noise there . ENTITY_LA has a lot of palm trees they are very high but not as big as ENTITY_Florida 's . ENTITY_LA has some foggy days but the climate is pretty good . January gets the most rain in ENTITY_LA. .
