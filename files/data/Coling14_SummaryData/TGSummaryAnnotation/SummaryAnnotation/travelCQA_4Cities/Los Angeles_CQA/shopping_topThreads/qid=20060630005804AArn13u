There 's parts called `` skid row '' where the homeless and soup kitchens are . Not dangerous but its depressing . Then there 's the Staples Center area , and that 's not too dangerous but I also would not just hang around for no reason ! In general downtown LA in the daytime is safe . People work and there 's a lot of people doing their business , like selling their merchandise or the corporate types doing their stuff . After 5 pm , the place gets deserted and only the restaurants and hotels are the only thing opened . Just be aware of your surroundings . If you are in the jewelry district for example , do n't go buy a 4 carat diamond ring and flashing it . If you go to the downtown area for clothes or to eat , then yeah , its safe . I go all the time with my mom and we 're both around 5 feet .

Some are safer than others , but most are fine for you to walk through if you do not portray yourself to strangers as an easy target . A whole lot of people are out and about on foot each day in downtown LA , so it 's not like you 'd be the only law-abiding citizen in town . Those folks safely make it through each day because they have developed a sense of awareness that tips them off when they see something or someone who does n't look right .

I 've been there a few times on my own as an adult , and I 've had a nice time walking around and shopping . I would n't recommend walking around downtown ENTITY_L.A. at night . Alot of areas are dark and have alot of transients . Do n't wear any valuables , leave the nice watches and jewelery at home . Pay to park in a supervised lot . There 's less of a chance anyone will break into your car . If you 're going with any females , they should n't carry purses , and do n't carry alot of money or your wallet in your pants pockets . I 've known people that have been pick-pocketed , especially in crowded areas . People I know usually put their money in a breast pocket or in their socks . For the most part , downtown ENTITY_L.A. is OK , and I 've never had anything happen to me , but I 've learned from the mistakes of my friends and family .

You might want to avoid the garment district though , it 's not dangerous but definitely shady , lol ... I would n't go there at night . . there is n't much there actually except some businesses . . most of the clubs and restaurants are in other parts of LA like ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , ENTITY_Beverly_Hills and ENTITY_West_Hollywood ... I lived in ENTITY_LA for 4 yrs and rarely ever went to downtown . .
