Maybe a swimsuit if you plan to go to the beach . Bring a little backback so you can carry your stuff in it at the amusement parks -LSB- which are so fun -RSB- thrust me you get pretty tired , a purse can get annoying . Some tank tops or shirts that arent made from heavy material , cuz im telling you it gets hottttt . And yes deff sunblock not sunscreen BLOCK its better . oh and maybe a nice pair of sunglasses too and for the amusement parks again , some nice comfy shoes . ;] good luck and hope you have fun i said flipss flops for just walking around , like if she goes to the mall . trust me i know , i live here .

I 'd bring a swim suit , something comfortable to go on rides -LRB- like mini skirts are harder to wear when getting in and out of roller coasters -RRB- comfortable shoes to walk around it , hair ties so you do n't have hair wiping you in the face , advil , and womanly products incase you get it in the park ! Have fun !

qid=20080501224458AAtDnhJ_answer_6	2	qid=20080501224458AAtDnhJ	2008-05-02 05:57:24 +0000	answer	 oo that 's cool ! im actually going to ENTITY_LA soon too , in the middle of may for my sisters graduation . Anyways that 's not the point . Well if you 're coming from somewhere colder than LA then you could bring something slightly cooler to wear around , and since its getting to be summer it can get kinda hot around there . Im coming from ENTITY_hawaii so when i went there it seemed FREEZING to me . so yeah if you 're coming form somewhere warm , vise versa . One place that i think you should check out -LRB- if you 're up for a drive -RRB- is to check out ENTITY_San_Diego , its not THAT far , i just came back from cali -LRB- ENTITY_LA and ENTITY_San_Diego -RRB- a couple weeks ago . But check out Seal World ! its reallllly awesome . But here 's a nice lil checklist i could think of Jacket -LRB- for nights out -RRB- Sunblock towels -LRB- at least one of your own -RRB- plastic grocery bags -LRB- if your beaching it up , you might want to put wet swim suits in here -RRB- Makeup !! -LRB- got ta look good ;-RRB- camera -LRB- calis pretty neat -RRB- hat swim suits -LRB- more than one -RRB- slippers -LRB- or as mainlanders call them `` flip flops '' -RRB- try to leave room in your suit case for souvenir 's and new things yeahh thats all i can think of for now . and if you wear contacts like me , DEFINITELY remember your contact case and glasses , or you 'll be doooomed . otherwise , do n't forget sunglasses ! hope you have fun ! cali can be great fun !!

I do n't care HOW hot it gets , you will be walking about 5 miles during a day at a theme park . Wear comfortable tennis shoes , NOT flip flops . I HIGHLY recommend New Balance shoes , they are the most comfortable walking/running shoes I 've ever tried . If you wear flip flops , your feet and ankles will be sore and hurting .

But bring jeans and a sweater too because it gets cold at night . You HAVE to go to hollywood . See the walk of fame , take a tour , go to the wax museum , and the ripley 's museum .
