There are some really nice parts , like ENTITY_Santa_Monica , but also some large chunks of the city that are very poor and gang-ridden . If you move there , be ready to spend a good part of your day in your car . For a big city , its public transportation is very poor . Make sure you go to the Getty Center -LRB- a kick-a ** museum -RRB- .

Also , can be a bit frighting , but you get used to the action . Interesting people over flowing everywhere . Nice stores . You should come by ENTITY_Sunset_Blvd. . It 's very nice there . Also Robinson Drive . is very nice but extremly expencive . That 's where you 'll get most luck with spotting celebs . For dating , it 's a huge variety .

Plastic Fantastic ! -LRB- ENTITY_LA is a made up place ! To paraphrase ENTITY_Gertrude_Stein `` There is no there there '' . -RRB- Anything you need can be found in ENTITY_Los_Angeles , it is a truly international city with loads of `` towns '' -LRB- ENTITY_China , ENTITY_Japan , ENTITY_Ethiopia , ENTITY_Armenia , ENTITY_Philipines , ENTITY_Korea , ENTITY_Russia , etc. -RRB- Obviously the entertainment scene is happening , and all the night clubbing that support it . Food of every price range and description is available everywhere . Free pre-released movie screenings available every night -LRB- if you can get there at the right time and stand in line for a while ! -RRB- Free Stand Up comedy at vaious clubs every night . It is a fairly safe place , in general , but it is really big and you have to have a car here . Check out ENTITY_Craigslist_Los_Angeles to read some personals and get the picture . There are loads of people here , from everywhere in the ENTITY_US and the world , someone is right for you ! Although I have found several fine friends here , the reputation is that ENTITY_Los_Angelenos are phoney , or pretentious . You will go farther here if you have your teeth whitened ... seems a common theme ...

It 's so boring and hot as hell . I sleep all day when i 'm visiting and then go out at night . Now that 's where it 's at ! There is nothing like going to the Strip and cruising . Nothing like it . It 's so exciting ! Better than ENTITY_New_York_City cus the traffic is not as horrific . The dating scene is nice . Just do n't take your self too seriously . Yeah most people are friendly . Really nice to ya especially if you 're buying something . In ENTITY_LA people are generally nice but you still have to be smart about your surroundings cus hey it 's a big city . My suggestion ? Sleep or shop all day then if you have some friends rent a car and cruise the strip . Dress up and look your best but do n't overdo it cus alot of clubs wo n't let you in if you look nasty . The best thing to wear to a club it a camisole some heels and some expensive jeans . Hope you have fun . I love ENTITY_LA and visit it whenever I can .

The outskirt suburbs are much nicer . Get a map and check out ENTITY_Santa_Monica , ENTITY_Encino etc. if you think you can afford to live there . If not make sure you take out a huge life insurance policy on yourself .
