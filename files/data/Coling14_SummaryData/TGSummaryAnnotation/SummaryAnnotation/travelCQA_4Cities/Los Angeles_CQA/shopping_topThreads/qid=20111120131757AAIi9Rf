For entertainment ? eBay . For gas ? ENTITY_Chevron . For oil changes ? Jiffy Lube . People from ENTITY_Los_Angeles like to shop anywhere .

It depends on where you are . CA is such a large area - the Camarillo Outlets are 54 miles from the center of ENTITY_LA - a long 1 hour drive -LRB- or MUCH longer , depending on when you attempt it . -RRB- On the far east of ENTITY_LA , out by ENTITY_Ontario_Airport , is ENTITY_Ontario_Mills , a huge complex , and close to that is ENTITY_Victoria_Gardens , another huge outdoor mall . This is also about 50 miles/1 hour if you 're lucky , from ENTITY_LA center . South of ENTITY_LA , you have many malls , but ENTITY_South_Coast_Plaza in ENTITY_Costa_Mesa , again a good drive , has many great stores and is very upscale -LRB- $ $ $ -RRB- as well .

For that high-end stuff , you go to Rodeo Drive . `` Locals '' like to shop locally , at the nearest mall . Contrary to what you believe , they shop at regular department stores like ENTITY_JC_Penney , ENTITY_Sears , ENTITY_Macy_'s , etc. .

Also - the ENTITY_Grove - you have all the stores like Coach , JCrew , FOrver21 , and there 's the ENTITY_Nordstrom which has ENTITY_Gucci , PRada and stuff . 3rd choice - the Beverly Center - not far from The Grove . An indoor mall on three floors featuring every bland bran you can imagine . The funnest one is 3rd street ptomenade , the ocean is right there when you get bored of spending money .
