I am English and going on a Californian exchange -LRB- staying at ENTITY_Huntington_Beach -RRB- in 2 weeks time and I was wondering what I should get the host family as a present . I live in Bath which is quite a famous place but I do n't know if Americans know it ... Are there any English things that Americans generally love ? Thanks

However it does not need to be anything elaborate . When some people go to ENTITY_Hawaii they bring back a small container of sand from the beach as a souvenir just to remember their experience . Since what most Americans know about Bath is the Roman springs why not bring a small vial of water from the springs . If you do this remember the airlines rules about NOT carrying more than 3 ounces of liquids aboard an aircraft . Please enjoy your time in `` Surf City U.S.A '' . I hope we Californians do n't corrupt you too much .

Go to one of the shops that sells local items , that 's a good place to start . Maybe a coffee mug with the city coat of arms , or Bath picture , if you can wrap it well so it does n't break in your luggage , or a book with lots of photos of Bath . Do n't worry about it , anything you choose will be appreciated ! -LRB- I know I 'd like some of those SL buns , but they 'd get smooshed in travel . -RRB- For kids/teens , a t-shirt from your school or town . If you have no idea on the size , get adult large or extra large for a teen , medium adult for 10 + , small for younger . They can grow into it , or shrink it . Even if it 's not sunny , you 'll want to wear sunscreen or moisturizer with a SPF here at the beach . Have a great visit !

Is there any local product like bath salts that you could give to the women of your host family ? I was going to suggest a football kit for the males , but you probably do n't know what size they wear . Bring them a Union ENTITY_Jack or the flag of ENTITY_England . A football scarf with your favorite team would be a good gift too . Americans just assume all Europeans like football aka soccer . It 's too warm here for wool clothing , but the ENTITY_UK does make some beautiful sweaters and scarves . A Hunch is right about the World Market at ENTITY_Bella_Terra . They have a small selection of English candy , biscuits , tea and beer . I love mint chocolate ENTITY_Aero bars .

Instead of bringing generic items that we may like , you should bring things that are special to you . Food or chocolate that you enjoy or t-shirts/items from your school . For when you get a bit homesick : In ENTITY_Huntington_Beach there is a store in the ENTITY_Bella_Terra mall called World Market . They have many ENTITY_UK products . Enjoy your stay !

It 's where those two chaps of the ` pop ' group ` Tears For Fears ' are from . One is ENTITY_Roland_Orzabal -LRB- a foreign surname ? -RRB- and I do n't remember the other chap . Well , ENTITY_Huntington_Beach is officially named ` ENTITY_Surf_City ' . The town is obsessed with surfers and surfing and riding waves and the surfing culture . As to English things we Californians love , well , I must say that we ADORE Princess ENTITY_Kate -LRB- Duchess of ENTITY_Cambridge -RRB- and of course PRINCE ENTITY_WILLIAM . We LOVE Princess ENTITY_Kate . I would say most families would be excited to get some souvenir bit or a trinket of them . Maybe such as dinnerware , glasses , decour , decourations , that sort of thing . When they visited ENTITY_Los_Angeles this year , it was very popular in the headlines !! I reckon anything regarding the new couple , and maybe even ENTITY_Beatrice ... -LRB- maybe even one of ENTITY_Beatrice 's fashionable hats . -RRB- Or , ... how about some photos and souvenirs of Bath itself ? You know , us Americans are very ignorant about 2 things : Geography and History . So , you might think of getting some historical info about Bath -- its origins and its scenery . That would be cool !! Oh , I forgot ... since Bath and ENTITY_Huntington_Beach are both fairly close to the sea , you might sort of bring something that we Californians are unfamiliar with about water areas and very historical items from Bath . Remember , a lot of ENTITY_Huntington_Beach people are simply obsessed with surfing . ENTITY_Best wishes ! from a Californian
