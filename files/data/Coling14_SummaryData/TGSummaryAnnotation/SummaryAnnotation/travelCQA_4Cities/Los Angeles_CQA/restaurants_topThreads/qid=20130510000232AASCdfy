I like ENTITY_L.A. because it 's always sunny , everything is nice , alot of shops , nice beaches ... But what 's the price of house or apartment ? Can you see some famous stars in hollywood ? Can you get some job easily or ? Are the food and gas expensive or cheap ? I was going thru ENTITY_L.A. on the google maps , and I have to say that it 's amazaing . . I 've visited ENTITY_Hollywood sign , ENTITY_Beverly_Hills , ENTITY_Venice_Beach , ENTITY_L.A. downtown and some random places . . I 'm very amazed with palm trees and nice always cutted grass :-RRB- Everything is just nice :-RRB- I hope I go there as soon as possible and get some place to live .

You ca n't possibly afford to live there right after high school unless mommy and daddy is willing to foot the bills . The city in GTA V is not an exact duplicate of ENTITY_LA. . You already knew that , right ?

I think everyone going to agree with me on that one . lol Gas prices here is the highest in the nation . I think we are only beat by ENTITY_Hawaii and sometimes we even beat them . It 's that crazy . Average costs of gas right now is $ 4.15 regular and it 's going up soon . Check ENTITY_GasBuddy . You can find a room to stay for about $ 700 . An apartment costs much around a $ 1000 and up . A house ? lol I can only dream , but they start at $ 600K and it 's not a very good neighborhood at all . Jobs are easy to find depending on what you are welling to do . Office position are tight and hard unless you have the right amount of experience ; at least a year , and more is better . Other stuff like cashiers , drivers , or security guards , we do have a lot of those jobs , but they do n't pay that well . And if you think you 're going to live out here with that job , you need TWO of them then . Food is cheap to expensive . We got all the fast food here and that 's pretty cheap , but if you want to eat out in the night life , then be ready to pay at least $ 40 to $ 50 a meal . One last thing , we do have a high to moderate crime rate and theft here , be careful where you go and when you go . Also , where you put your things . It 's not exactly , the safest place to be . Good luck

I love the weather , it 's warm all year round . The beaches are nice so the palm trees . It 's such a amazing place here , it 's quite easy to get a food service job here , just go across the ENTITY_Craigslist web and check it out , they need experienced worker , if u have them which is great . You got ta have a car to get around , it 's not nyc here when u can go everywhere by subway .

You can expect to spend at least $ 1000 ENTITY_US per month for a place to live . The job market has been tight for years , with little chance of improvement despite what you may hear on TV or read in the newspapers . The state 's tax code is organized strictly to punish business success . Did your virtual tour of the city include any stops in the poor neighborhoods ?

Cost of living is very high . Wealth equality is one of the most disproportional in the country . Few miles out from the glitz and glam of ENTITY_Beverly_Hills are the ghettos of ENTITY_South_Central , ENTITY_Inglewood , ENTITY_Compton , ENTITY_Watts , etc. . You do not want to get yourself caught in the wrong side of town . As far as weather , it would be one of the best . Sunny and dry year round .
