Now , mind you , I did n't say ENTITY_Los_Angeles or ENTITY_San_Diego , I said ENTITY_Southern_California , just as you have asked . There are plenty of wonderfully beautiful , quiet , safe and affordable communities throughout ENTITY_Southern_Califronia . And you just can not beat the weather . No other locale in the nation has better weather than ENTITY_Southern_California .

And I agree with the person that gave you ENTITY_L.A. and ENTITY_San_Diego -LRB- people tend to think of ENTITY_L.A. as only SoCal -RRB- . I 've lived in both cities . And to answer your question , SoCal is very expensive , the middle class lives paycheck to paycheck out here . However , there 's always something to do here ... and I 'm pretty sure we offer more recreational activities than any other place in the country . Moreover , it has it 's ups and downs , everything is not what you see on tv ... believe that .

You just learn how to deal with it . I love the climate . I used to live in NY and do not miss those winters one bit . It 's certainly expensive but worth it , ENTITY_IMO , and salaries are higher than in other areas . You get what you pay for . Visit first and see what you think and what the job opportunities are for what you do . It 's a huge area and as you get farther away from the big cities -LRB- like ENTITY_L.A. and ENTITY_San_Diego -RRB- , prices go down , but it 's still expensive compared to most of the country .

I live here and I 'm done with the whole `` Hollywood '' scene . There are a lot of stuck up people here . Some places are nice , but others are totally plastic . The weather is ok , but is n't very diverse . There is sun during summer , then mostly cloudy winters . Lately it has been cold during the winters ! But no snow !!! :-LRB- Its totally a personal thing , so if you visit you 'll get a better idea . ENTITY_San_Diego is my fav place here , and is kind of diverse in people and environment . But yeah it is VERY expensive most places here ! Good luck !

So ENTITY_Cal has it all ! And there is more to So ENTITY_Cal than ENTITY_L.A. ; check out other areas . Mountains , deserts , central coast , inland areas ... we do have something for every taste .
