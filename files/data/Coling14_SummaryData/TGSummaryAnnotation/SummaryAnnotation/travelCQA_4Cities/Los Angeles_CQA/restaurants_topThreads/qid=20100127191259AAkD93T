Amazing , quaint , fun and spectacularly beautiful . It 's different than other mountain getaways because it 's unincorporated . No large buildings , no fast food , no restaurant or hotel chains . Get a little cabin and have a wonderfully romantic time . If you want some suggestions of where to stay and what to do there feel free to email me . It 's about 120 miles East of ENTITY_Los_Angeles . About 2 hour drive .
