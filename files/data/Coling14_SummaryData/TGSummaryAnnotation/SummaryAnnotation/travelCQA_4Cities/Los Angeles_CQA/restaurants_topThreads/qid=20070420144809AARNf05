qid=20070420144809AARNf05_answer_1	1	qid=20070420144809AARNf05	2007-04-20 22:24:39 +0000	best_answer	 Ah , welcome to ENTITY_Burgerland , er , SoCal ! You 'll probably get plenty of responses on this one , here 's another : In-N-Out is pretty much the undisputed champion of burgers in SoCal . I do n't think anyone else even comes close . You must get the double-double -LRB- with grilled onions , if you like those -RRB- . If you want to live a bit on the wild side , ask for Animal Fries . It 's not on the menu , but there 's a bevy of things that are n't , like `` Protein Style '' -LRB- aka wrapped in lettuce , no bun - better for lo-carb diets -RRB- . Locations throughout SoCal . ENTITY_Tommy 's is another local phenomenon that is spreading out . The original one is on the corner of ENTITY_Beverly and Rampart , and you ca n't even sit down ! They feature chili burgers which taste delicious . It 's great comfort food , but your arteries harden just talking about one . Fatburger is a pretty good chain . I like their burgers , and especially their steak fries . But they are very pricey . You can get a burger , fries , and a drink at In-N-Out for about $ 5 - $ 6 , but it 's over $ 10 at Fatburger . If I 'm going to spend that much , I 'll go to ENTITY_Ruby 's Diner and get a shake with it .

I think the best Fatburgers is the one on ENTITY_Santa_Monica_Bl in ENTITY_West_Hollywood . I think Fatburgers is actually worth the price and not as crowded as In N Out which should change it 's name to Long N Out . Because of the long lines inside and outside in drive thru .

qid=20070420144809AARNf05_answer_5	2	qid=20070420144809AARNf05	2007-04-22 03:44:35 +0000	answer	 They are really good if you like usual burgers like with an egg on it or chilli and cheese etc. . Fatburger is located in many places however , ENTITY_Phoenix , ENTITY_AZ and ENTITY_Seattle , ENTITY_WA for example . If you really want an ENTITY_LA favorite burger , try Original ENTITY_Tommy 's ! They have the best and most desired burgers in southern ENTITY_California ! There are about 30 locations . Another west coast burger fav is always In-N-Out . Enjoy !

qid=20070420144809AARNf05_answer_8	2	qid=20070420144809AARNf05	2007-04-21 00:09:55 +0000	answer	 It 's overrated , In-N-Out is way better and cheaper too .
qid=20070420144809AARNf05_answer_9	2	qid=20070420144809AARNf05	2007-04-22 02:26:05 +0000	answer	 The name scared me away . ENTITY_LOL_Seriously though ! I never tried it because of the name `` FATBURGER . '' I felt like as soon as I ate it , I 'd become a balloon . It 's totally psychological . Same as I would n't shop at Cost Plus because I did n't know plus what ? Or how much more do I have to pay on top of the cost ? I love ENTITY_Carl 's Jr. . However it is getting pricey , too . Their $ 6 burgers cost $ 4.50 - $ 5 , so it 's not a major discount from the other more fancy sit-down restaurants they were trying to compete with .

I prefer In-N-Out , and even the other fast food chains . I 've heard that Fuddruckers is supposed to be good . I do n't know where they have on in ENTITY_LA though , since it 's sooo big . Good Luck .

qid=20070420144809AARNf05_answer_12	2	qid=20070420144809AARNf05	2007-04-21 15:23:06 +0000	answer	 incredibly expensive . There normal combo is like $ 9 . In N Out is a lot better . The thing about fatburger is the relish . Essentially it is whataburger with mayonaise and relish added . I only go there when I 'm craving whataburger and get it without those two things .
qid=20070420144809AARNf05_answer_13	2	qid=20070420144809AARNf05	2007-04-21 09:15:54 +0000	answer	 Fatburger tastes amazing , but as others have said , it 's pricey . In-N-Out Burger is obviously the champion . The double long lines at the drive-thru will prove so . Although their menu is minimal -LRB- burger , cheeseburger , or double double are you only options -RRB- , the fact that they have a `` Secret Menu '' is always exciting . http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp
