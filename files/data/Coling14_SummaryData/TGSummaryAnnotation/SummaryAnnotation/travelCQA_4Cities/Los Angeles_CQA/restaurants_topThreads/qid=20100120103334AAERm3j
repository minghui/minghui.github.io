My family and I are going to ENTITY_Universal_Studios_Hollywood this weekend , but we were planning on going to the ENTITY_L.A._Zoo on Sunday and maybe visiting ENTITY_Chinatown as well . Could you guys let me know a little about ENTITY_Chinatown as we have never been there . Is it safe to visit during the day ? Are there any areas we should try to avoid ? Is it something that is worth visiting if we have never been before ? Also do you guys know the best place to eat some inexpensive chinese food there ? There will be an 8 year old and 8 month old with us , so I just want to make sure we don’t go somewhere we shouldn’t be in that area . Thanks !

You have some chinese shops and restaurants . My favorite place to eat there is the The Empress Pavilion , where you can have dim sum . That 's where you order small dishes a la cart , and they are brought to your table one at a time . In any case , ENTITY_LA 's ENTITY_Chinatown does not compare favorably to other Chinatowns , particularly NY 's or ENTITY_San_Francisco 's . To be honest , I think you 'll have a much better time visiting Olvera Street , exploring ENTITY_LA 's Mexican beginnings . This is about as close as it gets to being in ENTITY_Tijuana , without all the gun battles .

Do n't go to Ocean Seafood Restaurant , they 're highly overrated , and their food is generic , and their waiters are so ridiculously rude ! Go to Foo Chow Restaurant , again the food is generic , meaning you find the same everywhere , but they have better prices and service ! Expect crowds ! Haggle prices ! I once bought my son one of those plastic water guns for like $ 3 ! and they were asking for $ 15 ! Now , Obvious spoke about ENTITY_Olvera_Street , go for it , it 's walking distance from ENTITY_Chinatown anyways , go and explore ENTITY_LA , there 's tons to do here .

Many Chinese Left there and live in ENTITY_San_Gabriel_Valley . ENTITY_China_Town is very close to ENTITY_Little_Tokyo , definite worth to check out there . ENTITY_Chinatown do still has good restaurant . If you like ENTITY_BBQ should consider eat in the ENTITY_Sam_Woo . ENTITY_Little_Tokyo most famouse restaurant probably ENTITY_Daikokuya_Ramen .

The larger issues you will face this weekend are the weather . If the storms keep coming being out and about will probably not be very safe for you and the kids .
