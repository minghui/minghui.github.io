We 're going there in September and staying at the ENTITY_Disneyland hotel . Can you recommend good places for breakfast -LRB- not necessarily buffet -RRB- not far away ? . We 've got two kids aged six and ten too . I think the buffet at the hotel would be too much ! I see the park does n't open till 10:00 am so that 's too late . Maybe somewhere that has cereal ; muffins ; pancakes -LRB- hotcakes to you :--RRB- ; sausages -RRB- . Thanks .

The breakfast for 2 eggs , 2 bacon , 1 sausage , potatoes and toast is $ 8.95 . Its no higher or lower than ENTITY_Mimi 's Cafe or ENTITY_Coco_'s . In the ENTITY_Disneyland park , located near ENTITY_Pirates and ENTITY_Indiana_Jones is the Riverbell Terrace . You can get the pancake breakfast there for $ 8.95 , and its a side of fresh pancakes , eggs , bacon or sausage and potatoes . There 's ENTITY_Denny 's and ENTITY_IHOP across from the park , but the prices are higher than those 2 menu items . I spent $ 16 for breakfast at ENTITY_IHOP , thinking it was cheaper to leave the park . I was wrong ! If you want just a quick breakfast , there 's the La Brea bakery near the check in part of ENTITY_Disneyland -LRB- on the Downtown Disney side -RRB- . You can get a muffin or pastry as low as $ 3 and they also serve hot meals . Go to the ENTITY_EXPRESS side on the left . The sit down part on the right is very expensive . The expess side has outside dining .

I recommend doing that . Goofy 's Kitchen is a little pricey , but there are other options . Also , Downtown Disney -LRB- between the Disneyland Hotel and the Theme Park entrances -RRB- has a few restaurants open . There 's also a ENTITY_McDonalds and ENTITY_Denny 's just across the street from the Trolley entrance to ENTITY_Disneyland -LRB- you 'd have to walk past the D/L hotel , through downtown ENTITY_Disney , past the front gates to the trolley / bus entrance , but it 's not THAT far of a walk -RRB- . Hope this helps . Enjoy your visit . I 've loved my visits to southern ENTITY_California , especially my most recent one .

They tend to get very crowed with all of the tourists . I 'd go a little farther down the street and enjoy some pancakes -LRB- hotcakes ??? they 're pancakes here too ! -RRB- at ENTITY_Baker 's Square -- sure they 're everywhere -- but this one is fairly close to ENTITY_Disneyland -LRB- for your sake I hope you 're getting a rental car -RRB- and usually not too crowed with tourists . Have fun . Any other questions feel free to ask -- I love ENTITY_Disneyland and would be there everyday if I could !

It 's free if you use it as a learning experience and teach the kids about the old `` dine and dash '' trip out the back door .
