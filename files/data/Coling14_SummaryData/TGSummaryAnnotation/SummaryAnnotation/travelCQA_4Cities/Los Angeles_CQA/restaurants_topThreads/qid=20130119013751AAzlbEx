If you will be on perdiem and they are paying your rental expense it might not be a bad idea but ENTITY_California is the most expensive place to live in the nation . My husband is an engineer and his company sends him to different cities in the ENTITY_US . He is currently living in a nice hotel and his employer pays all his living expense . Expenses vary significantly as he travels from state to state . I would recommend that you do a computer search for restaurants in the city you will be living in . The yellow pages will often list their menu and prices of the food . Maybe that will give you a good idea . Hotel food is more expensive than if you go out to eat at a restaurant that 's off site .

Food here is expensive . $ 100 a month would be very tough , you 'd have to make everything at home . ENTITY_Google : How to eat on $ 100 a month . You 'll see some good ideas , although ENTITY_LA is one of the most expensive cities in the country for food and everything else so you might have to adjust some of the ideas . I hope they are arranging to bring you here legally , because if they are doing anything illegal , you are the one who will pay the price and be banned from the ENTITY_US -LRB- I think it 's 10 years -RRB- , so make sure that you check on everything . Rent here is very expensive , $ 800 is the low end for a studio apartment in a so-so area , so hopefully they will be providing you with housing . And hopefully it 's decent housing . Good luck !

Your needs depend on how well you want to eat , and whether you plan to eat out a lot . If you plan to get most of your food from the grocery store and eat mostly at home , then $ 100 a week would be feasible , but you 'll have to buy cheap food , and you wo n't even be able to eat more than one or two fast food -LRB- McDonald 's -RRB- meals per week . If you plan to eat fast food every day , for breakfast lunch and dinner , then $ 100 might last you 3 days . If you want to eat at a nice restaurant once in a while , then make that two days . At $ 100 per day , you 'll be eating pretty well , and can even enjoy a few beers every night .

You have to eat no matter where you are , so most companies do n't pay 100 % of your food costs while you are traveling . Does your company have a visa to allow you into the ENTITY_US ? Where are they going to provide you housing ?

We also have an In n out here -LRB- Im not sure if you have that where you 're located -RRB- but its cheap and good . Theres always denny 's too ! You definitely have options for food . I do n't think you have to worry about that ...
