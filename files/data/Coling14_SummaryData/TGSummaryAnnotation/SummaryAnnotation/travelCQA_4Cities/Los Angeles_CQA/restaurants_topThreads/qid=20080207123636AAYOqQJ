I 'm taking a girls-only trip with girls and we want to go down to ENTITY_LA/West_Hollywood . We range in age from 23-25 . Where would be a good hotel to stay where we would be close to shopping and fun attractions ?

If you want good ones , I recommend the Best Western Sunset Plaza in ENTITY_West_Hollywood , the Renaissance in ENTITY_Hollywood , or the ENTITY_Hilton in ENTITY_Universal_City . Those are all good hotels in good locations . However , the prices of hotels in ENTITY_LA is high , like just about everything else . The ENTITY_Holiday_Inn_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame is right by the ENTITY_Hollywood_Renaissance , but I would rate it one `` star '' less than the Renaissance . Be prepared : Some people come to ENTITY_Hollywood , thinking it 's going to be all glam like ENTITY_Beverly_Hills , and are very disappointed . While it 's greatly improved from the 70 's and 80 's , it 's just not that glamorous .

I 'm not sure what a group of single , young women would do there . You wo n't be `` picking up '' any guys .

Hollywood blvd is a couple of blocks away and ENTITY_Sunset is just about a block from ENTITY_Hollywood_Blvd. . Theres a ENTITY_Hertz rent a car inside the Renaissance hotel down the street or a budget rent a car on Hollywood Blvd across from the Kodak Theater . From the hotel just ride a few blocks down ENTITY_Franklin to Sunset make a right and you will be in ENTITY_west_Hollywood in 5 to 10 minutes .
