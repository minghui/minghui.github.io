Then if you have time , go to ENTITY_Disney 's ENTITY_California Adventure . It 's not as good because it 's amller and the rides are not as good .
qid=20081007125606AA4Zftl_answer_2	2	qid=20081007125606AA4Zftl	2008-10-07 20:19:51 +0000	answer	 Get Parkhopper tickets ... once you see ENTITY_Disneyland AND ENTITY_California Adventure you wo n't want to leave . Also , with Parkhopper tickets , you can go back and forth between the two parks ... Sometimes ENTITY_Disneyland gets a little `` nuts '' busy , so you can go over to ENTITY_California Adventure , which is calmer and more relaxed . With Parkhopper tickets , you can go to BOTH parks both days , back and forth . Do n't miss the Soaring over ENTITY_California ride in ENTITY_California Adventure ... it 's awe-inspiring . ENTITY_Knott 's ENTITY_Berry_Farm , from what I remember , is very nice , relaxed park . The Chicken Dinner Restaurant is very good but very busy . Mostly , have a BLAST !!

Here 's a little known tip that I highly recommend . I got it straight from a ENTITY_Disneyland cast member and it 's the best tip * ever * ... When you pull Fast Passes for the `` big '' popular rides at both D-land or ENTITY_DCA , it will tell you to return between a certain time and use your Fast Pass -LRB- meaning the really short line -RRB- . Fast Passes are free ; you 'll see an area next to the big rides to get them . Most people think you can only return and use the ENTITY_Fast_Pass on the time indicated on the Fast Pass but it 's not true . You can use your Fast Pass ANY time after the first time on the pass . I do this ALL of the time and have absolutely no problems . In fact , the employee who told me this said if a ENTITY_Disney employee ever hassles you about it , get his/her name and report them at ENTITY_Town_Hall_on_Main_Street . What I do is immediately try and pull Fast Passes in the morning -LRB- you can pull one every hour or so . When you pull a ENTITY_Fast_Pass , it 'll tell you at the bottom when you 're eligible to pull another -RRB- . Then I just hang on to them and go on the ride later at MY convenience and not when it says on the ENTITY_Fast_Pass -LRB- like I said , it just has to be that day , after the first hour mentioned and it 's good -RRB- . I will often pull Fast Passes for Space Mtn , ENTITY_Indiana_Jones , etc. in the morning and go later at night ... It does n't matter . A good one to pull is ENTITY_Splash_Mountain because that line gets long fast and by afternoon , you ca n't pull fast passes anymore . So keep that in mind ; it 's the best tip I 've ever gotten . ** Edited to add : In my opinion , ENTITY_DCA only has a few good rides but one you 've got to make sure and go on is `` Soarin ' Over ENTITY_California '' . Do n't miss it !

ENTITY_Disney 's ENTITY_CA_Adventure is n't that fun and exciting in my opinion and ENTITY_Disneyland is wayyyy better !!

This is particularly handy when ENTITY_Disneyland gets crowded in the afternoon . That 's a good time to head over to ENTITY_DCA . So start at ENTITY_Disneyland when it opens , then hop over to ENTITY_DCA after lunch .

ENTITY_Disneyland is very big though so you may even want 2 days there . .
