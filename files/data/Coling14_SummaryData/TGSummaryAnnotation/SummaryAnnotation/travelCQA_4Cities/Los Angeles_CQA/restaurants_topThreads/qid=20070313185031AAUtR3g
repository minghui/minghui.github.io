As soon as it started getting hot 75 % of the girls at my school were all of a sudden orange ... and as clique as it sounds ... most of them have dyed blonde hair and white bleached teeth and it took me a REALLY long time to get used to the different type of people here . but on the other hand ... i 've met some of the coolest people ever here ! they are all from smaller areas around ENTITY_LA but theres always good and bad people everywhere you go . its not my style to be physically perfect either ... i 'm happy with * brown hair and * curves and * light skin haha so you just have to know yourself and then you 'll be able to see some of the people as different but still accept them . LA is fun ... lots of fun ... so even if the people do get to you . . enjoy ENTITY_CALIFORNIA !! : D
