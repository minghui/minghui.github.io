My parent has a house in ENTITY_LA and like someone to help stay for 2 years to get lower tax if he sells it after 2 years . If I go and stay for 2 years and can keep a job for that period of time , he would probably give me the house . But , I am not familiar with ENTITY_LA and it is larger and harder to get around , so I am worried that I may not be able to find a job soon enough like within 6 months before he thinks that I ca n't find a job and have to get out of the ENTITY_USA . I also do n't have much confidence of finding a job in ENTITY_LA because it is harder to get around and the economy and things in ENTITY_LA just seems more sluggish to me than ENTITY_Phoenix . -LRB- is that true ? -RRB- I like phoenix better and really prefer to live there but I would have to find a place to rent and pay rent myself . I am not that worried of not able to find a job in ENTITY_Phoenix than in ENTITY_LA. . . But if I do n't go to ENTITY_LA , my dad may not give the house to me ... So , what do you think I should do ?? Is it easy to find jobs in ENTITY_LA and can you find one in 6 mths ?

Yes , ENTITY_LA is bigger and harder to get around . But , come on ! You have a chance to get a house in ENTITY_LA ! Even if it 's not the best , do you know that the average house is over $ 400,000 ? If you DO N'T go to ENTITY_LA , I 'm going to give you the biggest DUH ! you 've ever seen ! Go , go , go !

I would say it would depend where the house is located in ENTITY_LA. . Some areas are not nice at all , but it would be a good experience for you . I am from ENTITY_California and LOVE it ! If you can not deal with heat DO NOT move to ENTITY_Phoenix . I would love to get a house for free !

People say ENTITY_L.A. and then they say ENTITY_Anaheim when you ask them to be more specific and anaheim is n't even in the same county as ENTITY_L.A. . If the address of the place you 're going to be living at is ENTITY_Los_Angeles_CA , then forget it and go to phoenix ... if its a nicer place then go for it . . VERY easy to get a job in ENTITY_L.A. if you actually try .

People risk their lives to come to ENTITY_LA every day , so please come . After a short time , you will feel used to it , and I imagine you will find a job soon . If money is a problem , you can -- very carefully -- also take in renters within the house after a while . Find them on craigslist and screen them with great care , getting references and all that . But for now , take the offer and get started . It 's a GREAT opportunity ! And ENTITY_Phoenix is too hot .

Just cus they live in so . calif does n't qualify them to be experts . They know nothing . all they do is answer for the points and if you notice a few of them they give the same answer over and over , . which means they are experts on the ability of cut and paste . If I had no job or other activities . id be sitting here all day . . but I have a life

Key word is sell it . He wants to make a profit without suffering the huge taxes that are slapped on sellers before the two year period . Will you be able to qualify for the home b/c homes out here are very expensive . Seems to me your Dad is asking you for a favor and will probably make it worth your time with a rent free home or a check upon selling . Before jumping the gun you should ask what 's in it for you b/c PROBABLY give it to you does n't seem like a definite to me . You will probably be able to get a job in ENTITY_Los_Angeles fairly quickly - especially if you 're bilingual . The ENTITY_Phoenix job market was good also . I actually had more job offers in ENTITY_Phoenix than ENTITY_L.A. but ultimately you have to do what 's best for you . Good luck .
