And there are any number of film , music , culinary and drama schools for them to attend . There are currently many under $ 100 per night motels/apartments in ENTITY_Central_Hollywood . Here are two $ 85 -LSB- total -RSB- per night places : Trylon Apartments , 6515 Franklin Avenue , Tel. : -LRB- 323 -RRB- 851 -RRB- 7036 ; ENTITY_Hollywood_Best_Inn , 1822 ENTITY_N._Cahuenga_Blvd. , Tel. : -LRB-323-RRB-?467-2252 . Both of these places are centrally located next to a major freeway -LRB- 101 -RRB- and major bus and subway terminals -LSB- the ENTITY_Metro_Redline is some 6 blocks away . -RSB- Also take note that they also have affordable weekly and monthly rates . Before arriving in ENTITY_Hollywod , you may want to scout for a job so you have a financial base upon which to draw upon . Good luck !

You will not get a decent room for under $ 100 or maybe a tiny bit less . No camping nearby , sorry to say . For transportation , look at the website I give you below . A day pass is $ 5 , and ask for transfers . Everything is expensive , as others have pointed out , but , travel expands the mind and soul . Examine your budget , and if you think you can make it , come on ahead , and enjoy it all !

There are no camp grounds within 40 miles . Hollywood is in the heart of a very large city . The people you see in tents near ENTITY_Hollywood are the homeless people . LA is such a large city that if you want to see things , taking the bus will use up 2/3 of your time . Renting a car is the only way to see things in a decent amount of time . Really , if you are that hard up , you may want to wait to visit ENTITY_LA when you are a little more flush . Also note that ENTITY_Hollywood is a seedy area . The stars do not hang out there and there is only one movie studio in the area . Great place to get a tattoo though .

ENTITY_L.A. and southern cali in general is based upon cars and the car culuture you need a car here its not like ENTITY_europe or even ENTITY_new_york where public transpo is easy and affordable here is a nightmare and really can only get you kind close to where you want to be .

Most of the hotels around ENTITY_Hollywood run $ 100 per night . If you want to pay less , you have to go to a hostel . There are no campgrounds in the ENTITY_LA area . The closest is ENTITY_Leo_Carillo_State_Park past ENTITY_Malibu . The next closest is ENTITY_Doheney_Beach in ENTITY_Dana_Point . -LRB- ENTITY_Dockweiler has an RV Park , but no tents allowed -RRB- . Welcome to ENTITY_LA_!

Check the exact location of hotel from google maps .
