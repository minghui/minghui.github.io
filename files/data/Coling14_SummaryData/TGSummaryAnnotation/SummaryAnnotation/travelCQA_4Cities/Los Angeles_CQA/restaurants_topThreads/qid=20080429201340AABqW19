Try and stay away from more trendy ENTITY_Hollywood clubs - they 'll rob you blind and anyplace with a velvet rope should be a sign that it 's gon na be lame and pretentious . ENTITY_Los_Feliz has a neat bar called the Bigfoot Lounge . The crowd is cool , the drinks are good , and the atmosphere is ... unique . http://www.bigfootlodge.com/LAhome.html If you want something more beachy - check out ENTITY_Paradise_Cove in ENTITY_Malibu but bring a hoodie because the ocean breeze can chill you even in warmer months . http://www.paradisecovemalibu.com/beachcâ€?For something more upscale but wo n't break the bank : http://www.moonshadowsmalibu.com/bluelouâ€?I visited the 4100 bar on Sunset a little while ago and I had a good time : http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profileâ€?Hope this was helpful .

My tastes are a less haute cuisine and lean more toward comfort food . When traveling , I usually spend $ 30 per person per day , which is a couple fast food meals , and a nice dinner . You do n't have t spend a lot in ENTITY_LA to taste the variety and get the flavor of ENTITY_LA. . The Roosevelt and ENTITY_Grafton are good places ... I always recommend the Renaissance ... Location , location , location . It 's right on the corner of ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland .
