I 've heard of alot of people moving there -LRB- or having moved out there -RRB- in order to get into acting but is it really necessary ? The reason why I ask is because it 's known as the Film/Television district and I 've heard that you 'll have a much better chance at getting work there than you would in ENTITY_New_York_City . What 's your opinion ?

Second : ENTITY_New_York . Third : ENTITY_San_Francisco_Bay_Area . There is a lot work to be found in these places . You do n't need an agent per say , but you need to make yourself available , and I do n't mean sex . I have been working on my first film project for a while and I have found some interesting and good and bad people in my area -LRB- ENTITY_Bay_Area -RRB- . I know there are many opportunities here as well as ENTITY_LA. . Just keep at it and work hard . Something positive can come out of it . Below are links where I found actors . Good luck .

There 's lots of production work in ENTITY_Toronto , and ENTITY_Prague is very popular . Study the trade papers , get to know the industry , be willing to take any kind of job so that you get to know people . Get a portfolio of pictures of yourself , and some acting experience would help . Good luck .

Keep in mind you will be a small fish in a very huge pond out here . There 's a ton of competition , a lot comes down to making the right connections . I have a few friends who have tried to make it but mostly end up doing a lot of ENTITY_Xtra work . Good Luck ! : -RRB-
