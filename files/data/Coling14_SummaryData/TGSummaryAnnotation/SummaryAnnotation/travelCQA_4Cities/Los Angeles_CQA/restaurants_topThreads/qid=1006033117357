qid=1006033117357_answer_5	2	qid=1006033117357	2006-03-31 22:56:10	answer	 Well I 'm gon na guess you asked this in `` ENTITY_Los_Angeles '' for a reason so I 'll tell you where I spent my time when I lived there . I like Internet Relay Chat and I spent a lot of time there online . When not doing that , I ate out a lot . I like in no particular order , ENTITY_Thai_Talay on Lincoln near ENTITY_Manchester , ENTITY_Siam_Best also on Lincoln but I do n't remember the cross street , ENTITY_Johnny 's Pastrami on ENTITY_Sepulveda and for high end , Moonshadows up in ENTITY_Malibu . Exhibition park is nice and ENTITY_Pasadena is just charming to walk around . I liked to go to open houses on Saturday and Sunday . It 's fun to see how people decorate their homes . There are great places to look at the ocean up in ENTITY_Palos_Verdes . . Get a map and find the ENTITY_Maliga_Middle_School . you can walk down to the beach from their parkinglot . Or just go up the road a bit and look at the ocean from Neighborhood Church . ENTITY_Catalina is a fun day trip . We saw dolphins and small whales along side our boat on the trip over . Hope this gives you some ideas of `` what we have done '' in ENTITY_LA. . Oh yeah , do n't forget ENTITY_San_pedro with the Queen ENTITY_Mary . Good mexican food down there called the Green Onion .

qid=1006033117357_answer_7	2	qid=1006033117357	2006-04-01 05:20:55	answer	 I used to live there for 5 months and most people spend their time in TRAFFIC . LoL just kidding . Here are places I think you should go and check out . The ENTITY_Getty_Museum - FREE public art museum , -LRB- $ 5 dollars for parking -RRB- If you do n't like art , its okay they have much more to offer , its ontop of a mountain , -LRB- you park underground and a monorail takes you up to the museum -RRB- so you get a great view of the city , they also have a sculpture/flower garden . And their soups of the day are cheap and very good . - ENTITY_Venice walk - Is fun to walk around , they have many street performers and alot of unique shops , on sundays , sometimes saturdays they have drummers that get together in a circle , and bang on pots , its cool to see . ENTITY_Malibu_Beach - I like this beach on the weekends . . its quiet and cleaner then venice or santa monica which is alittle south of it . ENTITY_Duke 's is a nice resturant . Food is good and you can sit next to the ocean and have waves crash against the window as you eat !!! They also have the best fish tacos !! They have a fish taco night where the alcohol and tacos are super cheap , i think its wed 's . In and out burger - classic hangout , good fresh fastfood burgers , fries and do n't forget your milkshake !! They give stickers out too ... Baha Fresh - good fastfood mexican - fish tacos are pretty satifisifying . also , for art museums , La and passadena have great ones ! Hang outs - coffee houses in ENTITY_LA. . There are tons !!!!!!!! so just go exploring and your find cool places to spend your time !!!!!
