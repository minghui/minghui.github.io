qid=20091218185133AAetXUF_answer_1	1	qid=20091218185133AAetXUF	2009-12-19 03:03:27 +0000	best_answer	 First , that is NOT ENTITY_Los_Angeles . There 's Main Place Mall in ENTITY_Orange -LRB- well , ENTITY_Santa_Ana at the edge of ENTITY_Orange -RRB- . That 's just about 10 minutes down the five freeway from you . Go further south and you can find ENTITY_South_Coast_Plaza , which has a lot of high end expensive stores . 20 minutes in good traffic , a half hour in bad . There 's a couple of not great malls in ENTITY_Anaheim . Main Place : ENTITY_Disneyland_Resort_Area_Travel_South on the I-5 . Exit Main Street . Turn Left off the off-ramp . Continue over the overpass . The South end of the shopping center will be directly in front of you . ENTITY_South_Coast_Plaza , take the 5 south to the 55 south , then the 405 north . Get off at ENTITY_Bristol and go north . It 's in ENTITY_Santa_Ana/Costa_Mesa . There will probably be signs . -LRB- I have n't been there in a long time . -RRB-

But really , a mall here is not a lot different than anywhere in the ENTITY_USA . If you want something incredibly different to tell your friends about , you want to go to the ENTITY_LA_fashion_district , just east of downtown LA , around Olympic Blvd. and ENTITY_Los_Angeles_St._DP a ENTITY_Yahoo search for `` ENTITY_Los_Angeles fashion district '' . Why settle for current fashion when you can go to the fashion district and get next year 's fashions and for cheap .

The ENTITY_South_Coast_Plaza is a bit further , but even bigger . The Block at ENTITY_Orange is an open air mall with restaurants and specialty stores , but no anchor stores . Same with the ENTITY_Anaheim_Garden_Walk . Brea Mall : Take Katella east to the 57 north , exit ENTITY_Imperial_Highway and turn left . Ca n't miss it . ENTITY_South_Coast_Plaza : 5 south to 55 south , then 405 west . Exit ENTITY_Bristol north . Block at Orange : Take 5 south to ENTITY_The_City_Drive . ENTITY_Anaheim Garden Walk : East on ENTITY_Katella a few blocks . -LRB- Main Place is actually in ENTITY_Santa_Ana -RRB-

These are in ENTITY_Los_Angeles -LRB- not ENTITY_Orange_County -RRB- but these are fun , upbeat , family-orientated places . The ENTITY_Grove has a big Christmas tree right now and often has outdoor concerts .
