The Westin on ENTITY_Century_Blvd is just one among many . But yes , you do need a credit card at check-in even if you are paying with cash . As far as what 's available in Hawthorne you can go to ENTITY_hotels.com or ENTITY_expedia.com and search for hotels and motels in that city sorted by price . And on wanting to find a place that is so rank and disgusting that they would let you pay for just a few hours ? Please respect yourself and your girlfriend and stay somewhere decent .

Back in the old days , you could just check in , and hotels didn’t care as long as you paid . But insurance companies , who DO pay attention to all sorts of statistics , noticed a very high percentage of room damage claims from the under-21 crowd . These kids would trash a room , and the hotel would make a claim with their insurance company . Sometimes they would pursue the hotel guest to recoup some money , but more often they didn’t . At that point , the insurance companies got tired of paying all these claims caused by rowdy kids . So when these hotels wanted to renew their insurance , the insurance companies insisted upon a policy that nobody under the age of 21 be allowed to check in . Otherwise the hotels would not be insured against damage . So in order to keep in business , the hotels agreed . Most of their business comes from over-21’s , anyways , and they were also pretty tired of having to deal with room damage left by rowdy kids . So it’s nothing personal , it’s just a numbers game that the insurance companies forced on the hotels . Just business . Just add it to the list of things you can’t do any more , like letting your kids run around all day by themselves . -LRB- If you DO find a hotel without a 21 + check in policy , it’s going to be a real dump , used mostly by hookers and drug users . -RRB- But call the hotel to find out their policy .

Many times you need a credit card because of possible damage that guests might make . However , unless you 're going to a sleazy place , they would still charge you by the night .
