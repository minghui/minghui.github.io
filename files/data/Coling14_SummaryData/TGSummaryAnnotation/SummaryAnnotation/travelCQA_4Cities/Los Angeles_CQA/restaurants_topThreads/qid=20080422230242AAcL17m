qid=20080422230242AAcL17m_answer_1	1	qid=20080422230242AAcL17m	2008-04-23 15:42:55 +0000	best_answer	 There 's lots to do in downtown LA. . Just be careful at night . If you 're into flowers check out the ENTITY_LA_Flower_Mart early in the morning . It 's next to the ENTITY_LA_Fashion_District . Grand Central market is also another place to see during the day . I also like the Jewelry District because I love jewelry . If you 're into nightlife have dinner at Blue Velvet for a great view of the city then afterward go to the Roof Bar at the ENTITY_Standard_Hotel , Seven Grand and to the ENTITY_Edison for drinks . Club 740 if you want to dance . You need to dress up for all those locations . If you want to slum it with the hipsters drink at the ENTITY_Golden_Gopher , ENTITY_Broadway_Bar and ENTITY_Redwood_Bar_&_Grill . For culture go to the Museum of Contemporary Art and ENTITY_Walt_Disney_Concert_Hall . Olvera Street to see the original ENTITY_LA settlement . Across the highway from Olvera Street you will see the landmark ENTITY_LAPD building . Union Station is also next to Olvera Street and is worth looking at for the architecture and to hop on the ENTITY_Metro_Rail . The Cathedral of our Lady of the ENTITY_Angels is very pretty . If you want to eat in a strange and kitschy restaurant go to ENTITY_Clifton 's Cafeteria . If you want to eat at the place where the French dip sandwich was invented than eat at ENTITY_Philippe_'s . The ENTITY_Pacific_Dining_Car has been open 24/7 since 1921 . It 's also another place you need to bring money and dress up . If you have lunch at the Kyoto Grand Hotel & Gardens you can view their half acre Japanese Garden that is on the 3rd floor . It 's a cool thing to see in the middle of the city .

There are also many dance venues . Sports : ENTITY_Staples_Center . Museums : MOCA and the Temporary Contemporary . There are movie theaters , clubs , and many fine restaurants , and shopping of course . The main library is there . You might be able to wangle an invitation to a private club for a very special meal . You can work out at any of a number of places , including the storied ENTITY_LA_Athletic_Club or the Downtown Y . Then there is the whole Artist Loft district with its endlessly interesting streets and galleries opening up daily . And the garment district , known also as the Fashion District , around 9th and ENTITY_LA_Streets . And if you are interested in architecture , the ENTITY_LA_Conservancy gives wonderful tours that will teach you things you never dreamed about this wonderful town . You can even walk in any day and wander around the most forward architecture school in the ENTITY_US , ENTITY_Sci-ARC , in the ENTITY_Loft_District . Every day it is safer to walk around downtown , and if you listen to people who do n't live here , you will get an out-of-date point of view , but ENTITY_LA has changed and is changing . Just pick up a free copy of the ENTITY_LA Downtown News anywhere for a map showing all these things and what 's doing at the time you visit .

The architecture is amazing and it is located across the street from ENTITY_Olvera_St._L.A. 's oldest street which has many gift shops , mexican restaurants and street vendors . From there you can walk one block to ENTITY_China_Town and do some more shopping and eating . You then can go back to Union Station and hop on one of the ENTITY_Metro_Lines and visit the civic center , ENTITY_Hollywood and other areas . There are maps at the station to plan the rest of your day .

ENTITY_LA is the epitome of urban sprawl . It is a patchwork of cites all connected together with lots of suburban areas in between . The ENTITY_LA area is almost the size of ENTITY_Connecticut if you factor in ENTITY_LA_County , ENTITY_Orange_County and ENTITY_Part_of_Riverside . Down town ENTITY_LA over the years has been called many things , but has basically been trashy : Cheap hotels for drug users and prostitutes , homeless people everywhere , dirt and pollution , etc. . You wouldn’t want to live there . And it wasn’t even the center of where everything . There is the ENTITY_Convention_Center , ENTITY_Olvera_Street , museums , and Staples Center , but you did n't want to be in ENTITY_Downtown_LA at night . However , that’s changing rapidly . There has been a big move in the last few years to revitalize downtown . Upscale strip malls are going in , along with high-rise condos that cost around a half-million and up . Downtown is actually becoming a vibrant place , with the addition of the Nokia Theater . Within 20 years , downtown LA will be a very desirable place to live , work , and visit .
