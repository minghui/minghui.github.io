Loads of entertainment nearby , but you might have to sit on a stairway to eat if there 's no tables open . The line moves fast , and the food is good . Stay away from the Buzz Lighyear Stage area food , and the resteraunt in Fantasyland ... Nothing but rubber . If you have a little more time , go to the Pasta place in ENTITY_Tomorrowland . Plenty of seating , and very yummy ! I like the chicken alfredo . If you 'd like to sit down ... go to the Pavillion for Breakfast with the ENTITY_Pooh characters . It 's a buffet . They come to your table once every half hour . And they will keep your child occupied .

Do n't know if you can get by with that now . They probably would mistake your hero sandwich for a bomb , and blow salami all over everyone !

We also brought our own drinks , and snacks for the hotel room and breakfast milk and cereal , breakfast bars , yogurt , goldfish , cheez it 's etc etc. .

There are many options on places to eat at ENTITY_Disneyland , so let me give you my run down for choices when you are with your child . First , let me say that since you have a small child ENTITY_DLR will let you bring a sippy cup and some food in your bag . Make sure you have some crackers/goldfish/trail mix that your child likes so that no matter where you are you can head off a hissy fit when hunger strikes . There is nothing like being in a line , just about to get on the ride and having a meltdown ! My daughter 's favorite place to eat is the Hungry Bear out in Critter Country . We go to the lower level and sit by the river . She loves to feed her fries to the ducks and watch the boats go by . The restrooms for this part of the park are also in the downstairs area . ENTITY_Munch_Inc. kids meals are served here . In Fantasyland there is the Village Haus Restaurant across from the ENTITY_Casey_Jr. . Train . Restrooms are just outside the restaurant . They serve the ENTITY_Munch_Inc. kids meals here , too . I have eaten in ENTITY_Toontown , but there is absolutely no shade , so if it is a sunny day it can be miserable . Kids meals are available . In ENTITY_New_Orleans square it 's nice to go to the ENTITY_River_Belle_Terrace for a sit down meal . There is a nice view of the river area . This is also convenient to ENTITY_Adventureland . If you need a break from the park there is always the ENTITY_Rainforest_Cafe in ENTITY_Downtown_Disney . However it is at the very farthest opposite end from the entry plaza . Take the monorail if you go ! Have a happy trip ! Good luck !

Get your hand stamped and walk the few feet outside to one of the fun restaurants at ENTITY_Downtown_Disney , just outside the park 's entrance . For your little one , I highly recommend The Rainforest Cafe . They have great food and a fun atmosphere .
