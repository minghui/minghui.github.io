qid=20090513130625AAU963P_answer_1	1	qid=20090513130625AAU963P	2009-05-14 01:42:42 +0000	best_answer	 The ENTITY_Truth_Disney_World is almost always better ENTITY_Disneyland is only better than ENTITY_Disney_World only in the month of August . Either way ... your going to have the best time of your life any time at either place . However most think outdoors in ENTITY_OC_&_LA `` Disneyland '' is one of the greatest place in the world during summer , but some times are better than others , but all are good . Well that is the facts and nothing but the facts . BUT Both are over run with visitors that time of the year . Moreover its really too hot for all young kids , especially in July and August at both . The best time during Summer Vacation is , the very soonest school gets out ... like MAY or June !! Moreover anything but summer vacation time . But whenever you do go ... go the earliest you can . Like before it opens at 7AM . Get one of the breakfast programs that will let you in earlier than everyone else by a few hours , like at the hotels and in ENTITY_Downtown_Disney . Most of all go take a very long lunch break at 1PM , even leave or go watch a movie in the PARK at `` Downtown Disney '' But come back for dinner and all the night shows . Last but not least you can and should not try to do/see all of ENTITY_Disneyland nor trip in under a weekend . It takes more than just weekend to do the whole park ... on a weekend . However only two days during the week . Moreover there is a lot to do all around both parks , especially in the ENTITY_OC_&_LA , Like at Knot 's & all the beaches and events going on during the weekends . ENTITY_PS Tuesday is often one of the best days to do the RIDES . Almost all ride LINES on weekends can and will be over an hour on weekends during July , moreover under 10 minutes on Tuesdays before noon in early June , because few can go on that day , moreover everything is still going on , just like every other day . So go off peak time for the younger kids and to get your money 's worth .

It 's usually not as hot in southern ENTITY_California as it is in central ENTITY_Florida in the summer , but both parks are equally crammed with people taking the kids away on summer vacation . Be prepared for big crowds , long lines , and very long waits for rides -- even with FAST passes . There is a HUGE difference between ENTITY_Disney_World and ENTITY_Disneyland . To put it in perspective for you , the entire area of ENTITY_Disneyland could fit in the parking lot for EPCOT . It 's possible to do ENTITY_Disneyland and see just about everything in both parks -LRB- the original ENTITY_Disneyland and the ENTITY_California Adventure -RRB- in 2 days . For ENTITY_Disney_World in ENTITY_Orlando you need at least 4 days , more like 5 . The original ENTITY_Disneyland is very much like the ENTITY_Magic_Kingdom at ENTITY_Disney_World , but ENTITY_Disneyland has one very cool ride that ENTITY_Disney_World does not have -- The ENTITY_Indiana Jones Adventure . ENTITY_Disneyland also has The Matterhorn , which is a so-so roller coaster , but Space Mountain at ENTITY_Disneyland is light years better than the one at ENTITY_Disney_World . The other half of the park is the ENTITY_California Adventure . It 's very similar to the east coast amusement parks of the early 20th century , with some cool shops and restaurants strategically placed between the ENTITY_California Adventure and ENTITY_Disneyland . I only visited the ENTITY_California Adventure once and did n't much care for it ii nice piece of nostalgia , but no cool `` new '' attractions or rides . BOTTOM LINE : I would n't do either park in the summer or around Christmas vacation , but if I had to pick one over the other I 'd be on my way to ENTITY_Orlando because there 's so much more to see and do there .

If you answered yes , then it 's a good idea . ENTITY_Disneyland is a bit kiddy while ENTITY_CA adventure has a lot of rides for adults .
