I have always wanted to live in ENTITY_California , it has been sort of a dream of mine for as long as I can remember . But with houses being like $ 300,000.00 and rent being a couple grand a month , how does anybody afford living there ? The least expensive houses here go for $ 30,000.00 and not a lot of people can afford them . What is the secret ? Is the pay higher there ?

With an average 1BR apartment going for $ 1200 per month , it 's difficutlt to do it . Kids out of high school have to stay home until they can get enough skills to get a job that pays over $ 30,000 per month . Some people share an apartment . Our oldest daughter lived with us until she was 26 . It 's not easy . The `` secret '' is patience , a good resume , and the fact that we do have slightly higher salary scale here . ------- Ooops , that 's $ 3,000 per MONTH .

I have my own apartment and I pay all of my own bills including a car payment . Budgeting and not living beyond my means helps . A lot of people have to work more than 1 job and have roommates to make ends meet . A lot of people also have high paying jobs . ENTITY_Los_Angeles and ENTITY_California are quickly becoming a place of haves and have-nots . The middle class is moving out of the state .

Most people out here have cars worth more than $ 30,000 . Its just the price you pay for having one of the best weather and amenities in the ENTITY_united_states .

Just save a lot of money before coming . . both find a job ... then take your time and find that perfect house . Oh I live in ENTITY_North_Orange_County , ENTITY_Ca .
