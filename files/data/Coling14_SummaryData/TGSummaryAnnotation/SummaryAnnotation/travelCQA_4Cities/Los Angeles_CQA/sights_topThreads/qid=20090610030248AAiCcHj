It 's totally free , and open 7 days a week . Then you have ENTITY_Chinatown which we really enjoy . Be sure to stop by the historic ENTITY_Union_Station . It 's stunningly beautiful inside . ENTITY_Hollywood_Boulevard has the Manns Chinese Theater , a beautiful movie palace from the 1920 's . The interior is filled with ENTITY_Chinese antiques . The ENTITY_Hancock_Park section of ENTITY_Los_Angeles , where I live , is also on the historical list . It was actually the `` first ENTITY_Beverly_Hills '' , where movie stars lived , many still do -LRB- ENTITY_Melanie_Griffith lives here -RRB- , before ENTITY_Beverly_Hills was developed . All the homes here are truly historical treasures . It 's a treat just to drive around . ENTITY_Beverly_Drive in ENTITY_Beverly_Hills also have old homes from the 1920 's . The ENTITY_Beverly_Hills_Hotel was one of the first buildings of that city , and ENTITY_Beverly_Hills was actually developed around it . There is also the ENTITY_La_Brea_Mammoth_Tar_Pits , on Wilshire Blvd next door to MOCA -LRB- museum -RRB- . Have fun taking your relatives around . ENTITY_Annelie

One small street jam packed with bus loads of people . Full of souvenir stores that sell overpriced junk you do n't need . Parking is ten bucks and as an added bonus just across the freeway is skid row . Check out the Getty Center its free -LRB- parking ten bucks -RRB- or maybe the ENTITY_Los_Angeles Farmers Market . Another interesting place is the ENTITY_Griffith_Observatory which is also free and parking costs nothing .
