Now that I 'm independent but dependent on a mother who is a complete pain in the butt living in her stupid home feeling like a baby I desire to have myself my own home but before I go I was thinking what if ENTITY_California is n't my home what if my life was a complete waste that I deserve to die for what I work hard on was for nothing and I know it might cause I have nothing to help from anyone or anywhere but I want ENTITY_California to be my real home for it was always my dream to go there to see hollywood , to visit beverly hills , to see the golden gate bridge , to talk with millions of ENTITY_California girls making me feel open , to meet with actors and actresses I never encountered and be with the race of my heritage but I do n't know cause inside me I feel scared and I have a feeling it wo n't go well so please what should I do ?

You do n't have what it takes to live here -- yet . Get yourself an education and a good job before deciding to move here . Otherwise , you 'll find yourself on the phone , in tears , begging your mother to come get you . It 's a shame . I 'm only a year younger than you and I know better than this .

Ah , you 're really dependent . As for all this ENTITY_California BS , you need to stop believing everything you see on TV . You 're living a fantasy world . I always find it interesting how parents are a `` pain in the butt '' ... getting you to do things for yourself that you should have learned already : Clean up after yourself , get a job , get some responsibility , etc. . So , I 'll tell you what you should do : Get a job . Move out . Get a place to live . Pay your own bills . In that order . Do NOT come here to SoCal . Not because it 's not the greatest place on earth , but because it 's too expensive for you here . Get a college degree , some skills , then move here .

I have been there twice and it is by far the worst place in the entire world I have ever visited -LRB- and I am a quite well-travelled individual -RRB- It is extremely polluted , the whole state is just a big pile of urban sprawl , -LRB- If you are within 280 kilometres of a major city there will be nothing but subdivision houses as far as the eyes can see -RRB- and the people are hostile . I got yelled at for crossing the street during a green light ! It was n't even an advance green ! Trust me , there is nothing even mildly of interest in ENTITY_California . If you want to go somewhere interesting , come here to ENTITY_Canada .
