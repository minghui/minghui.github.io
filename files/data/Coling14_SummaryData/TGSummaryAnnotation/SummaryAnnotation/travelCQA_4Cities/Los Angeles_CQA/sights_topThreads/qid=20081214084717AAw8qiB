Sure we have movie stars but you never really see them and if you do its not as exciting as people make it out to be . The houses look really nice but they are extremely expensive , even the regular ones . And then you have the wonderful fires that burn many houses in the hills each year and pollute the valley . Oh and did I mention that we are expecting a huge earthquake in the near future because we have n't had one in a while ? If you do n't mind all of the above though , the weather is really nice and there are really good places to go on vacation near by .

Weather , combined with geography , combined with liberal politics combined to make it THE destination . Let 's face it , if the weather were like ENTITY_Buffalo 's and the policital clime like ENTITY_Russia 's , no one would be here .

I think it 's cool that stars live there but a lot of stars are annoying and if you do n't live in the ENTITY_LA area you 'd never see any anyway . ENTITY_San_Diego is a great place because it stays at 70 year round . I 'm serious and it 's a nice city . ENTITY_Los_Angeles probably is n't that great though because a four bedroom house for $ 400,000 is about $ 3 million there . It 's also a pretty dirty city but there is some cool stuff like the ENTITY_Hollywood sign and all . ENTITY_San_Francisco is nice too . The Golden gate bridge is cool and for some reason the houses are cool . Either way ENTITY_Calif is more expensive then the average state like in the summer gas was $ 4.70 and where I live in GA it was only $ 3.80 . Also ENTITY_California is running out of money AND they have problems with earthquakes -LRB- because they 're on the edge on the tectonic plate boundries -RRB- and forest fires -LRB- because it 's so dry and windy -RRB- It may not be the best place to live even with the cool beaches but it 's nice .

I chose ENTITY_LA because I was offered a dream job here and the weather is pretty good . Though today was too cold for me to go for my Sunday bike ride . On the other hand , My daughter , who went to high school here , has fallen in love with ENTITY_West_Virginia and thinks it is heaven on earth and intends to stay there after she gets her grad degree there . I used to live in ENTITY_Vancouver_BC and that is a fabulous place to live . I only left as I was offered a more interesting job in ENTITY_LA. .
