It 's not . It 's considered the ENTITY_California_Heights area of ENTITY_Long_beach and is right next to what is called ENTITY_Bixby_Knolls . These are very desirable neighborhoods . Like all areas of ENTITY_Southern_California , there is always some bad behavior -LRB- stolen cars , etc -RRB- . This is not a gang area . Based on the specific area , you are listing , I 'm guessing that it 's an apartment building and most apartment buildings will have people of all nationalities and income levels . I think you will like the area better than ENTITY_San_Bernadino .

What bothers me about the city is that the `` great '' areas are pretty much like oasis surrounded by the `` bad '' areas . ENTITY_Wardlow_Road is OK . It butts up against the 405 freeway so it is not a `` big oasis '' . It is also a pretty heavily traveled street with a mix of apartments , business and industrial buildings all mashed together . The odd thing is if you go north into ENTITY_California_Heights it is a nice area -LRB- except for the airplane noise -RRB- but a little further north -LRB- after 36th street -RRB- and it turns into a ghetto . To the south you have the freeway and then the startings of Signal Hill which , again , can be good and bad . In general , it is an OK neighborhood . No better or no worse than most parts of the ENTITY_South_Bay/LA_basin .
