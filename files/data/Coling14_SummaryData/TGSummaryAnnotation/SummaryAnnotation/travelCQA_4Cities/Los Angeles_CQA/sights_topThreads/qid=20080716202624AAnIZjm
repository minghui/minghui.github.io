My family and I are going to ENTITY_Disneyland_L.A in 2 weeks.The drive is a few hours from ENTITY_Arizona to ENTITY_Los_Angeles so we decided that it 'll be best to stay at a hotel overnight . Can anyone tell me a nearest hotel from ENTITY_Disneyland you 've stayed in and you highly recommend .

He did not make that mistake in ENTITY_Florida . As a result , in short order ENTITY_Disneyland was quickly surrounded by what one wag described as `` the world 's greatest collection of 1950 's motel architecture '' . Since then , hotels in every price range and description have been built . There are probably 10,000 hotel rooms within a mile of ENTITY_Disneyland . There is no question that you have to stay overnight - ENTITY_Phoenix to ENTITY_Anaheim will be about 6 hours drive -LRB- you did n't say where in ENTITY_AZ -RRB- . No way could you do a round trip plus a park visit in one day . -LRB- I guess it 's theoretically possible to leave at 4 ENTITY_AM , arrive at 10 AM , leave the park at 6 PM and get home at midnight , but that would be nuts . -RRB- If it were me , I 'd make a longer stay of it and see something else , too , while I was here . I think you 'll be best off staying two nights : 1st day drive ENTITY_AZ to CA , 2nd day visit ENTITY_Disneyland 3rd , etc day - possible other sightseeing last day - drive home . You can stay at one of the Disney hotels -LRB- Grand Californian or Disneyland Hotel -RRB- , a huge ENTITY_Hilton or ENTITY_Marriott , or any of dozens of other choices . Just decide your price range , and make a selection . Most of the hotels probably have a shuttle to the park , so you can leave your car at the hotel .

While some hotels are closer , these two are very close to the front entrance , so you can walk back to the hotel for a swim or a nap in the afternoon . They are a step above the other hotels in the immediate area in terms of rooms , service , pool , and value . The HoJo recently added a themed pool , the only one outside the ENTITY_Disneyland_Resort property . Check out the location below : http://www.galttech.com/research/travel/â€?If you have about $ 400 to spend for one night , then the Grand Californian is the place for you . It 's right on the property , and the best hotel in the area . And it 's Disney-owned .

There 's plenty of hotels in that surrounding area because of the park , it wo n't be difficult to find a good one , as long as you do n't stay in one owned by ENTITY_Disney . I 'd suggest The Desert Palms Hotel and Suites , it 's a short walk from ENTITY_Disneyland 's main entrance .

It is a beautiful place and you can get a theme park view . If price is somewhat an Issue then I would say to stay and ENTITY_Howard_Johnson 's -LRB- hojo 's -RRB- it is right across from the front entrance and if you become a free member on Laughingplace.com you can get 15 % off of the price which is a great perk and they also have a theme park view , which tend to go faster then the other rooms . Hope this helps you , and enjoy your trip !
