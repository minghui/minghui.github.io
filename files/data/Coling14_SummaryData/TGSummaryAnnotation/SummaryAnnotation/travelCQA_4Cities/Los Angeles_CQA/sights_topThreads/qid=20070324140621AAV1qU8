This place is really cool they have plenty of stalls in selling all sorts of items ranging from Ceramic figures of Mayan/Aztec gods to candies and sugar skull , to candles , leather goods , and catholic images . you can also find clothing and really good Taquitos . Besides it 's a really cool place to go and see where ENTITY_Los_Angeles was born , You will also see ENTITY_Pico_House used to be ENTITY_Los_Angeles Tallest Building and first Sky Scraper it now houses a museum I believe you 'll also see ENTITY_LA 's ENTITY_First_Fire_House and yes they do have a donkey BUT ... You have to go on a weekend for sure to catch the Donkey or during the week during a festival like day of the dead . Depending on how you get there I would choose to take the Red Line so that you could check out ENTITY_Union_Station .

If you drive , it 's near ENTITY_Alameda and Sunset -LRB- ENTITY_Cesar_Chavez -RRB- at the north end of downtown . Olvera Street is the center of the `` ENTITY_El_Pueblo_de_Los_Angeles '' historic park , the original site where the city was founded . It 's both fun and historically enlightening , and most of the attractions are free . The place also has some of the best food and shopping in ENTITY_L.A.

Just try to find that . And also i think it crosses cesar chavez blvd. / street the donkey is not there all the time -LRB- it 's a fake one by the way -RRB- . you should try going there on a sunday , there are so many people there ... so it is the most probable time for the donkey to be there . it 's really interesting to see . also , there is a really cute little cafe in the olvera street , it 's called cafe de souza ... go there and try a mexican hot chocolate ... sooooo good . you can also try to wikipedia olvera street , or downtown ENTITY_LA
