If possible , arrange to go to ENTITY_LA for several days or a week before you move , and schedule interviews during that week .

Scheesch , it 's not like moving to ENTITY_Moscow for gods sake , give it a shot . Worst case scenario is you get a great tan ...

Find a apartment guide online , you can get one lined up b4 you get there.Go to monster jobs or any other employment website , get some interviews lined up.You can also find a book on LA at your local book store or online.Most important just do it , follow your dreams.Good luck .

If you do n't have anyone to stay with , save enough to stay in a hotel for a week or two . That can be as much as $ 70 a night for a cheap hotel . Find a job before you move , even if it means flying out for interviews . If you do n't , you will need more money saved . The first day you get here , start looking for an apartment . If you make enough to get an apartment on your own - great . If not , look at Craigslist or consider a paid service like ENTITY_West_Side_Rentals to look for someone looking for a roommate . It might take you a week or two to find a place to live , so plan on living in a hotel until then . As long as you save enough before you move and have a good plan , you should be fine . Also , pay off your credit cards -LRB- if you have debt -RRB- before you move so you can use them if you need to . The biggest mistake people make is moving here without enough cash saved up . Jobs do n't work out , roommates move out or whatever - and you need the cash .

If you have family in ENTITY_L.A. , then it will be an easier adjustment . Expensive does n't even begin to describe the cost of living ! I 'd suggest having a job lined up ahead of time , spend a week looking around the area for both a job and a desirable place to live . Have plenty of money to fall back on , especially if you do n't land a job right away . Stylists seem to be on every corner ... are you looking to make it in a big-time salon , or just any mom & pop business ? The competition is stiff , and connections tend to be the ticket to making deals happen . I 'm sure you 'd find something that suits you fine though . Since you 're 20 , I 'd assume you 're just starting out , so explore all your options , look online for housing & jobs , arrange some interviews , and hop on a flight . Good luck !

Tips are important and establishing a clientele . Start with a studio in a suburb and budget your money . Your hair must be great looking every day and exercise your back to avoid soreness .
