You can do things such as hang out at the beach , shop , lots of restaurants , kayak , snorkel , glass bottom boat ride , miniature golf , hiking , take a tram tour of the island , rent a golf cart , see a movie , go to the botanical gardens , etc. . I would not suggest staying for more than 2-3 days as the town is very small and you may run out of things to do after that time .

It can be crowded on weekends so your better bargain will be during the week . The island is small and there are lots of things to see , and do , but by the end of the second day you 've seen it all . Most of the activities revolve around the ENTITY_City_of_Avalon . Automobiles are rare on the island so rent golf carts , or bicycles to get around , however if that stretches your budget most things are within a short walk . Inquire about the inland things like horse back riding , etc. . It will be a good educational experience for your daughter . Include ENTITY_Catalina_Island as a part of a vacation in the greater ENTITY_Los_Angeles area .
