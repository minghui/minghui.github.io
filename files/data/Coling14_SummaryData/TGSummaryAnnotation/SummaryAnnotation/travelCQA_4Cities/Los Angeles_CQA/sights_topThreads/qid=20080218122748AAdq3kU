Right across the street is Olvera Street , and you have ENTITY_Phillippe 's a couple blocks away , and ENTITY_Chinatown a couple blocks away . However , there is one other thing a couple blocks away that most people do n't realize , and it 's not exactly a tourist destination : ENTITY_Los_Angeles_County Jail , including the ENTITY_Twin_Towers . Inmates are released all hours of the day and night , so it is NOT a safe place to stay . Even if there were a hotel by Union Station , I would n't recommend it . There are no $ 30 hotels here in ENTITY_LA. . The real estate is just too expensive . If you want something that cheap , check out the hostels in ENTITY_Hollywood . Also , the attractions are spread out , and are difficult to get to without a car . ENTITY_Hollywood is about 8 miles . The beach is 17 miles away . ENTITY_Disneyland is about 25 miles .

No is not located in a Ghetto , and if it was what 's wrong with that ? Union Station is the safest place to be day or night . The Couny Jail is close by , but the men that are released are only thinking about getting way from the area . I work on Skid Row . Skid Row is close by , but the homeless are not at Union Station , and Skid Row is a safe area . No there are not any rooms for $ 30.00 now that 's Ghetto .

There 's no real night life in that neighborhood . If it is your q I answered earlier , it is a mile north of the ENTITY_LA_Mission . Otherwise , there are hotels , but I am not aware of hostels . -LRB- I will look and come back and amend my answer if I can find you a good one nearby . -RRB- Suggest you do a lot of web research between now and then for your travels . From Union Station , you can take the Red Line to ENTITY_Hollywood or a bus to the beach . Get a $ 5 day pass and just go and explore . I love to explore new cities and highly recommend you buy a book so you do n't miss much -LRB- or at least do that web research -RRB- . ENTITY_LA has many wonderful museums , concert halls , architecture , nature , people , and sights . I actually think your biggest problem will be the lodging , so try to solve that soon and get it off your mind so you can enjoy all the rest . Oh , try the link below ... and enjoy our wonderful city , and ENTITY_San_Diego too .
