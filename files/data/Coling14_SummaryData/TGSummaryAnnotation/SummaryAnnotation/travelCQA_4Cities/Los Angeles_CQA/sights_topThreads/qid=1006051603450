qid=1006051603450_answer_1	1	qid=1006051603450	2006-05-16 10:45:41 +0000	best_answer	 ENTITY_Disneyland is the original theme park that ENTITY_Walt_Disney opened in 1955 . ENTITY_Walt_Disney_World is the 43-square mile complex located in ENTITY_Central_Florida . The ENTITY_Disneyland_Resort -LRB- officially the company does n't allow anyone working for them to just say `` Disneyland '' anymore ... they have to say `` Disneyland Resort '' or `` DLR '' for short -RRB- now has two theme parks : The ENTITY_Magic_Kingdom -LRB- aka `` Disneyland '' -RRB- and The ENTITY_California Adventure . There 's also a retail/entertainment district called `` Downtown Disney , '' and three ENTITY_Disney owned hotels : The ENTITY_Disneyland_Hotel , The Grand Californian , and Paradise Pier . ENTITY_Walt_Disney_World contains four major theme parks -LRB- The ENTITY_Magic_Kingdom , ENTITY_Epcot , ENTITY_Disney/MGM_Studios , and ENTITY_Disney 's Animal Kingdom -RRB- , two water parks -LRB- Typhoon Lagoon and ENTITY_Blizzard_Beach -RRB- , a retail/entertainment district -LRB- also called `` Downtown Disney '' -RRB- , a campground -LRB- Fort Wilderness -RRB- and a plethora of Disney-owned hotels . Walt was disenchanted by how `` closed-in '' ENTITY_Disneyland had become after awhile , and so when he set out to build another park , he snatched up a whole bunch of land in the ENTITY_Orlando area ... so no one else could build right outside his park . There 's a now-famous story about how it got leaked out that he was coming . A reporter for what is now ENTITY_The_Orlando_Sentinel called ENTITY_Walt and said , `` We are running a story that you 've bought all this land for a theme park here in ENTITY_Orlando . Do you have any comment ? '' Walt replied , `` Why on earth would I want to come to ENTITY_Central_Florida ? '' and the reporter ran the story . Why ? Because back then ONLY people who lived in and/or were very familiar with the area referred to it as `` Central Florida '' , and after the paper ran the story , the ENTITY_Disney company confirmed it .

For starters , ENTITY_Disneyland was first , but is smaller and only has two parks . ENTITY_Disney_World was opened until many years later , but is now larger and has four parks . Not to mention the different castles , rides , etc. . So , to help you out I think you will enjoy this site : http://www.mickeynews.com/Columns/PrintCâ€?Which one is better ? Well , that just depends what you want . ENTITY_Disneyland is smaller with only ENTITY_Disneyland and ENTITY_California Adventures . Both parks are also smaller . ENTITY_Disney_World has four parks and ENTITY_DisneyQuest , they are larger and a lot more to do . I believe that all of ENTITY_Disneyland can fit on the parking lot of ENTITY_Magic_Kingdom . They do have some of the same attractions , but not all of them are the same . There are few at each park that are n't at the other .

This is the only theme park ENTITY_Walt got to see constructed and finished . ENTITY_Disneyland is much smaller than WDW -LRB- obviously -RRB- but its still the original . More locals visit ENTITY_Disneyland than its Floridian counterpart . ENTITY_WDW is much larger in size and also has more things to do . The property is spread out and it practially its own little city . The ENTITY_Magic_Kingdom is the closest in comparison to ENTITY_Disneyland , but ENTITY_WDW also has ENTITY_EPCOT , ENTITY_MGM -LRB- very similar to ENTITY_Universal_Studios -RRB- , ENTITY_Animal_Kingdom , as well as water parks , themed hotel resorts and 2 , 3 and 4 star restaurants . ENTITY_WDW has more world wide visitors and would take multiple days to see everything , whereas ENTITY_Disneyland a visitor can see almost everything in 1 or 2 days .
