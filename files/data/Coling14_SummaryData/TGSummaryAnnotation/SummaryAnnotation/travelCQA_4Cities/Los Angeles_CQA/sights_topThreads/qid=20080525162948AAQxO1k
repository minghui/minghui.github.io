Some of the city 's most beautiful homes are located in ENTITY_Toluca_Lake . Windy roads , beautiful homes , lovely yards and gardens , a short walk to lots of shops and restaurants . Many people in ENTITY_Los_Angeles have n't even heard of ENTITY_Toluca_Lake so are n't familiar with it . The homes are some of the nicest in the entire city , incuding ENTITY_Beverly_Hills . As for schools ... you need to visit them to see which you like best . You can try ENTITY_Campbell_Hall , ENTITY_Harvard-Westlake ... Notre Dame in the Valley is n't that great . Be prepared to spend upward of $ 25,000 a year for private school . Public school is free of course , but , you will not get a good education . ENTITY_Toluca_Lake teenagers go to a high school shared by residents of ENTITY_North_Hollywood , which is poor and has gang violence . You will need to go to a private school .

It is right at the 101 and the 405 . Central to a lot of stuff . Do n't know much about schools in ENTITY_LA. . If you can swing it - try and get a private school . The gang influence is pretty heavy in ENTITY_LA. . Stay away from them . I 'd try and pick a good school that has done a lot to stamp out the influence of the gangs . No good ever comes from being part of one . The members end up mostly dead or in jail . By all means go try the mexican food out there . Do n't go to a chain restaurant - they are overpriced and the quality is inferior . Go to a small mom and pop place . The food will be great tasting and not too expensive .

ENTITY_Harvard-Westlake_School is in the ENTITY_Holmby_Hills area . Very competitive private school and they probably wo n't let u in the middle of the term . ENTITY_Notre_Dame_High school is another roman catholic private school that 's quite good . ENTITY_Toluca_Lake has a million movie stars living there . ENTITY_Sherman_Oaks is less upscale but still very affluent and a great place to live in . Good luck finding a good school in the ENTITY_LA area though . WELCOME TO ENTITY_THE_CITY_OF_ANGELS

I 'd prefer to live in ENTITY_L.A. proper or even ENTITY_Santa_Monica if you ask me , the valley is scorching hot in the summer .
qid=20080525162948AAQxO1k_answer_6	2	qid=20080525162948AAQxO1k	2008-05-26 08:44:09 +0000	answer	 I have lived in both ENTITY_Toluca_Lake and ENTITY_Sherman_Oaks . They 're both very nice areas . ENTITY_Sherman_Oaks has more shopping and dining options and is a bit bigger than ENTITY_Toluca_Lake . You might find that you like ENTITY_Sherman_Oaks better because of that . I do n't know anything about the schools in that area as when I lived there , I did n't have a child yet . :-RRB- You will probably love living in the ENTITY_San_Fernando_Valley -- there is so much to do there ! Good luck and have a wonderful time .
