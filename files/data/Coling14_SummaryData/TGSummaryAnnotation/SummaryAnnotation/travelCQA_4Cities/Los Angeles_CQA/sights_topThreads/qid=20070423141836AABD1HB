The studios are located in a nearby city called ENTITY_Burbank . If you want to be an audio engineer , welcome .

If you do n't like ridiculously high prices for gas , housing , etc , do n't move there . If you do n't like diversity , do n't move there . If you have panic attacks from just getting lost , do n't move there . ENTITY_Los_Angeles is HUGE . If you do n't like protesters , do n't move there . If you love winter or four seasons , do n't move there . If you happen to go there , have a very open mind . ENTITY_Los_Angeles is n't just the ocean , palm trees or ENTITY_Malibu .

Everything is spread out but I think that 's why we like it . No one goes to the REAL downtown for much of anything . Nothing there but offices . If you can handle lines , traffic , high prices , driving EVERYWHERE to do ANYTHING , aggressive and mostly superficial people , then come on over . It 's big , so be prepared to get really familiar with our complex freeway system . I could n't imagine living anywhere else and I 'm sure people who come from out of the area could n't imagine living here .

The weather is awesome year-round , and you 're within 1-2 hours drive from surfing , skiing , wine country , desert , beaches , rolling hills , etc. etc. . If you want to be a sound engineer there is no better city to live in - this is where entertainment happens . It can be hard at first to meet people and make friends , but once you have that network established your career will be set .
