I am visiting ENTITY_California for a week and am spending all of tomorrow in ENTITY_LA. . My friends and I want to go to The Museum of Contemporary Art -LRB- MOCA -RRB- but do n't know what else there is to do around there . We were thinking about visiting the ENTITY_LA art district but are not sure what exactly to expect there or if its located close to MOCA.We would like to take advantage of any photo ops of any type of art we can . Is there anything around MOCA that is `` artsy '' or `` crafty '' and cheap haha ? PLEASE HELP !

Look it up online to see what it looks like since you did n't want any web links . The ENTITY_Geffen_Contemporary at ENTITY_MOCA is another MOCA museum you can visit in downtown LA. . ENTITY_Little_Tokyo in downtown LA is a fun place to visit . Lots of Japanese restaurants , shops , museums , Japanese gardens and Hello Kitty knock-offs . They even have sneaker shops with Japanese only imports . The newly constructed ENTITY_LA_Police headquarters in downtown LA has strange blobs as part of their public art display . You could ride the newly reopened ENTITY_Angels Flight funicular in downtown . If you saw the movie 500 Days of Summer the park that they liked to visit was in that location . There is a Gallery Row in downtown LA. . You can even visit the Museum of Neon Art while you 're down there .

However , you can see other types of `` art '' in ENTITY_LA. . How about taking the Red Line Subway to Union Station ? The old style architecture there is very beautiful , even if the people are n't . Union Station was built in the 1930 's , when rail travel was THE way to go . Then go across the street and see the ENTITY_Avila_Adobe at Olvera Street , for an example of mission-style architecture .
