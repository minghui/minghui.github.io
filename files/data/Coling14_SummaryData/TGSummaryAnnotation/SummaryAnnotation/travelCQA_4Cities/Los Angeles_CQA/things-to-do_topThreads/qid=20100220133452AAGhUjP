Yes , ENTITY_LA is nice , and a great place to be young . If I did n't like it , we would n't be living here , but it is true that it is hard to make ends meet here .

In ENTITY_LA , CA it 's ridiculously expensive , and people making $ 100,000 live in apartments because they ca n't afford to buy even a small home in an nice area . If you live near the beach in ENTITY_LA , CA , you likely go to private school or a highly regarded public school , so that means tons of homework and no time to go to the beach during the week . If you do n't live near the beach , it would take too long to get there after school , we have slow public transportation . It 's hard to find a beach to have a bonfire , they are n't allowed at most beaches anymore . The beach is cool even in sunny So ENTITY_Cal , unless it 's summer , and it gets windy and cold . Depends on what school you go to if sports are intense , at some schools , sure , but it 's not ENTITY_Texas . I do n't know what you mean by ENTITY_California girls , but if you mean tanned blondes , nope , we have every type of girl imaginable . One day visit and see what I mean . But do n't feel like you 're missing out on anything until then , it 's just a place to live . -LRB- Oh , and do n't call it ENTITY_Cali , it sounds really poser and I know you do n't want to be a poser . -RRB-

The weather is good , so people go to the beach more and play more outdoor sports , and yes , there is natural beauty , but people are pretty much the same as anywhere else . They go to work every day and make a living .

Do n't come unless you have a job lined up . We have plenty of unemployed people already . The cost of housing will be more than double what it would cost in ENTITY_Wichita -LRB- if you happen to come from there -RRB- and the quote , freeways , are consistently jammed . Our state government is in perpetual gridlock and the real estate market is in the toilet . Life in the central valley and gold country is like a different planet compared to the coast .

Realize going in that there are some beautiful parts , as well as ugly parts . Not everyone is like they show on TV . In fact , few people are . Sports are intense . They do bonfires in summer , not during school year . No , they do n't go to the beach after school . In winter , the beach is rather cold , and not very fun . So get those images out of your head . Just go with an open mind , and realize that it has both good and bad . People here have problems , just like where you live . The only difference is that we probably have better weather . That 's all .

The other thing is that the weather is such that it wo n't be good to go to the beach about four months of the year . The drama you refer to is the same as all teen girls around the country . However , you will have to keep in good shape and look good in a bikini because there is more Competition for fashion among girls in ENTITY_LA than most of the country .

You can turn it into anything u want , ENTITY_rli . . its all the mindset u choose

In my area , which is in ENTITY_Sonoma_County , we have every social group you can imagine . I love going downtown because you see them all at once . The good beaches in CA are ENTITY_Monterey to ENTITY_South . In northern the sand turns to pebbles , they get colder , the drop comes sooner , and the under tows are crazy . Not much fun for a beach party . Although we do have a few decent beaches . Not everything is happy in ENTITY_Cali . We have violent places that are no good for touring . But we do have great places you 'll never want to leave . Do some research and find out which areas you would have the most fun in !
