I heard it is a little less crowded once summer vacation is over . I am wondering if anyone has any advice on how to budget the trip . When is the best time to book a hotel ? And is there a hotel that is not a Disneyland Hotel that is within walking distance that someone has stayed in and would recommmend ? Also , is it just best to watch for deals on enterance tickets ? Any other tips/advice would be great . I am not on a strict budget , but I would like to get the `` most bang for the buck '' so to speak . Thanks in advance ! ENTITY_P.S. . It will be me , my husband and the 4 year old boy : -RRB-

Very close walk to ENTITY_Disney . Check out their site at hojoanaheim.com . As for deals on tix , this is actually the best time to go -LRB- Jan-March -RRB- . You have a modified `` 2-fer '' ticket , where you can go to any park for 2 days , one park per day , for $ 99 . You do n't have that kind of a discount in the fall . Right now , the weather is perfect , about 75 during the day . We might have rain this weekend , and temps around the low 60 's . In the fall , weather is usually pretty hot , so it 's your call .

And there is this store called Lush it sells organic beauty products . It is kind of pricey but you do not have to buy anything just walk in and they will give you free demonstrations it is like the best store ever you should defiantly go in

The only time I have experienced the least amount of crowds is in December before Christmas . People are too busy with Christmas / Holiday expenditures and shopping . Check the ENTITY_Disneyland website for ticket deals . The deals are usually for when you are going into the park more than a single day or when you want to go to the two parks or if you are a Southern CA resident -LRB- they have deals right now through April -RRB- . There are a lot of hotels around the park . And there are public transportation buses that go from most of these hotels right to the park . Good luck .

There are motels all around ENTITY_Disneyland , many have shuttles to the park.Hotels on the east or west side of the park are closer to the entrance of the park , still too far for a kid . Rent a stroller at the park . You will have to do a hotel search for the best rates . I think there is a 3 day pass that is probably be your best bet . You can go in and out of the park as you wish for every day of pass you buy . This way the kid could nap and be in better shape to handle things if this is possible .

Getting discounts on tickets is rare , but sometimes ENTITY_Costco has deals for members .

These are the only times when the park is not celebrating a holiday or there is n't any big vacation time -LRB- summer/spring break -RRB- . For hotels , ENTITY_Priceline.com has worked quite well for us . You can enter the price you want to pay , the location of the hotel , and how many stars you want . If they find something for you , you have to take it . Start with a low price and a higher-rated hotel . You might be surprised . There are a ton of hotels near the park . You might want to reserve the hotel as far in advance as you can . You can always buy park tickets when you get there . As for park tickets , they occasionally have deals for ENTITY_Southern_California residents . They do have deals for multiple-day tickets . You have to have proof of your zip code . Otherwise , there are really any good deals that are 100 % legit . Good luck !
