Millions of people do everyday . But should you ? In some parts of the city it 's not a good idea . Plan your trip within walking distance of your hotel . Bicycling is an option , but with all the crazy drivers be extra cautious . Hey , maybe there 's someplace you can rent a Segeway ! How cool would that be ? You could take a taxi to some of the places you want to go , but it could get pricey . I 'd say , stay somewhere near the beach and just kick it .

Then depending on where you want to go , you get a hotel within walking distance . Also , some attractions have shuttles that take you there . I would talk to a travel agent for the best suggestions . You might even try AAA if you are a member or someone you know is .

There are public transportation however if you 're not familiar with the place then you might get lost . Plus you 'll be wasting your time waiting for bus . Another thing is buses dont have 24 hr service . Taxi could be expensive too . Life here in ENTITY_CA without a car sucks .

One way to vacation there is to just stay at a beach hotel and stay around that area . You can easily rent a bike there and just bike along the beach . There 's a bike path that runs through all the nice beach cities . You can also rent kayaks and sailboats . Then maybe you can have the hotel concierge book you on a tour to the usual attractions like ENTITY_Hollywood , etc. .
