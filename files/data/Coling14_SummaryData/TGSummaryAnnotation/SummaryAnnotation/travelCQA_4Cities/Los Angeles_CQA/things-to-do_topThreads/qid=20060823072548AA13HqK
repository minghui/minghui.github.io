qid=20060823072548AA13HqK_answer_1	1	qid=20060823072548AA13HqK	2006-08-25 04:18:58 +0000	best_answer	 You have several options when planning a ENTITY_Disneyland stay . Check out the packages of local hotels -LRB- check out ENTITY_Harbor and ENTITY_Chapman area in Garden Grove -RRB- , as well as the ENTITY_Disneyland resorts . If you have the money to spend you ca n't beat staying on site . It makes it nice to be able to take a break during the day , go back after dinner , etc. . As far as tickets , if you do n't go with a package deal , the web prices do tend to be better . The best deal though is a 4 day ticket available through ENTITY_Costco . The only catch is you have to have a SoCal zip code on your ID to get the ticket exchanged at the ticket booth . This is not a problem if you are coming to the park with someone local . They can exchange all of the tickets with their ID at the ticket booth . Also , it does pay to have the tickets in your hand before you get to the park . It frees up time to stand in a line for something you actually want to see ! Happy travels and good luck !

Hotel packages are good , but I think if you try travel sites like ENTITY_Expedia or ENTITY_Travelocity you 'll find good deals at nearby hotels . I would suggest one in walking distance to the park so that you can dash back to the room for lunch or a nap -LRB- if travelling with kids -RRB- . Hotels a little further away may have better prices and most offer a shuttle to the park .

Many hotels near ENTITY_Disneyland are offering package discounts , so save time and money by browsing the web in advance . Just search `` discount tickets ENTITY_Disneyland_Anaheim . '' Also , it depends on when you are traveling , how many days , and the number and ages of people in your party . If you are traveling after summer vacation , you 'll get even better rates . Have fun !

It 's in nearby ENTITY_Anaheim , which is in ENTITY_Orange_County -LRB- not ENTITY_LA_County -RRB- . Get a park hopper online . Save yourself at least one line .
