They have hot chocolate stands set up . Parade and fireworks , snow falls on main street after the fireworks . It 's a Small World changes for the holidays , so does Haunted Mansion . It 's pretty neat . If you do n't have kids or want to do that kind of stuff you can get through the big rides easier during the night parade and fireworks as a lot of people line up early or go to main street during that time .

It 's a great photo-op with the tree and the castle in the background . The Haunted Mansion is decorated as The Nightmare Before Christmas from Oct-early January . Small World gets decorated both inside and outside -- I do n't really care for the ride myself , but the decorations are incredible ! One of my favorites is Storybook Land -LRB- the boat ride by Teacups and Dumbo -RRB- . All of the little houses have Christmas decorations . Too cute ! The fireworks are always awesome , and sometimes you will get lucky and catch carolers strolling up and down Main Street . The park as a whole looks so festive and cheery . Have fun !

Try and get a table by the water . Food 's so-so but it 's just a fun and different dining atmosphere ! You have to early - first thing pretty much - to make a reservation . They fill up fast . I think there 's a number you can call , too . Call D-land and find out . The character dining - such as the Arielle place in ENTITY_DCA - is fun as well .
