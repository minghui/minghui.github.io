The town of ENTITY_Avalon is easy to travel by foot , everything is centrally located , restaurants and shops etc. . You can also rent a golf cart to get around . There are plenty of ENTITY_Santa_Catalina_Tours to take you into the interior of the island , as well as Boat tours . Have fun . ENTITY_Annelie

I know I had this problem taking my Dad there . Around town you can rent the golf carts they are fun and handy .

I went this year with my 70 and 65 year old parents and they had no issues with walking to the Wrigley Memorial and generally all over the town . They are in very good shape though . The website below lists lodging and restaurants in the area since we do n't know what your budget is . Since it 's high season prices are going to be more . If I had my choice I would stay at the Zane Grey Hotel although not with my mom since they only have 1 queen bed per room .

ENTITY_Hamilton_Cove is the next closest , and the best place to stay . It 's a VERY small town , and very relaxing . Enjoy . http://www.hamiltoncove.com/

Everything else you can rent a golf cart or take a city tour to see other parts of the island . It 's been a few years since I 've stayed on the island , but during the week pretty much everything closes around 5 or 6 pm . As for hotels , Ive stayed at the ENTITY_Pavillon lodge . http://www.visitcatalinaisland.com/avaloâ€?Nice hotel that is right on the strip .
