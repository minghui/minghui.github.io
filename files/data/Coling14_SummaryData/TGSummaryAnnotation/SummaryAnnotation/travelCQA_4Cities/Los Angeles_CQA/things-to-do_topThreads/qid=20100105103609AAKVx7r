I 'm thinking about working at ENTITY_Avalon_Bay_Company in summer with my friend . They are providing a house and it says everything is walking distance except the shopping mall . Can we survive with 900 $ a month ? How 's social life there -LRB- cinema , activities , etc -RRB- ? Should we choose another place to work -LRB- in the city and not on an island -RRB- ? Tell me all you know about ENTITY_Catalina : -RRB-

On your day off you can always take the ENTITY_Express over to ENTITY_Long_Beach , and be there in an hour . It 's about $ 65 round trip . Everything you need on ENTITY_Catalina is walking distance , but you might want to bike , there are also taxis , and the trolley/tram . There is n't all that much to do unless you have friends to hang out with . I do n't know if you mean like a real mall , because there is n't one . There is a movie theater in the Casino , but it 's not a gambling casino , it 's a ballroom for events . There is a ENTITY_Vons , near where you 're going to work . There is shopping to get most of what you 'd need . If you do n't scuba dive or at least snorkel , you might want to start , ENTITY_Catalina is a great place for it and it 's a major activity on the island . If you mean $ 900 each , that should be enough since you do n't have to pay rent , depending on if you have bills or how much you want to spend . ENTITY_Catalina is a mellow place , usually the kids that work there over the summer are into scuba diving , hiking , kayaking , golf , or just hanging out on the beach with friends . Many kids would think it 's a much better job than spending the summer working at other low wage jobs in the city , and there likely wo n't be too many of those around this summer , summer hiring expected to be down again this summer . Good luck !

It 's callled the Avalon Theater and they run first run movies . Right now they 're showing ` ENTITY_Sherlock_Holmes ' . It 's probably the fanciest movie theater movie you have stepped into . Very Art ENTITY_Deco and very ornate . The closest shopping mall is in ENTITY_Long_Beach , definitely not walking distance . If you 're under the age of 21 than I 'm sure you would be bored unless you like to hike or scuba dive . If you want to get away and enjoy peace and quiet than you 'd probably like ENTITY_Catalina . If I were you I would buy a ticket to check out the island in advance .

Some family hotels , mom and pop restaurants , a nice beach , BEAUTIFUL water . That 's it . As for social life , you hang out in the bar with the other locals . Cinema ? ROTFLMAO . There is no cinema on the island . ENTITY_Catalina is basically a place you go to slow down and really get away from it all . Really FAR away . Not much in the way of malls , cinema , stores , or entertainment . It takes a certain type of person to live out there . If you want excitement , ENTITY_Catalina is NOT the place to go . If you want to relax with a slower lifestyle , it 's perfect . Great for scuba , snorkeling , swimming , hiking , or just hanging out at the beach . -------------------------------------- I stand corrected on the cinema !

Everything is within walking distance and there are no cars in ENTITY_Avalon . Social life is very limited and quiet except for a few tourist spots .

Bird Girl , a regular here , is , I believe , the only regular here who actually lived on the island , so she would know about actually living there ... I think she lived on the remote west side of the island for a while doing some kind of nature conservancy thingee ... Maybe you can find her here somewhere in Yahoo Answers World ...

Update us with the mundane and extraordinary events of your stay . Keep it going everyday . Maybe it will catch on and your blog will get sponsors . That 's easy money for you . I know I would find it very interesting . I bet teens and kids would enjoy it also . It would show them what to look forward to when their parents drag them out there . Let summer school teachers know about it and they can webcam questions to you from the classroom . This could turnout to be a big break for you . Just thinking outside box .
