I can tell you I really like the place . Has a small gym , a decent sized pool and jacuzzi . Only a 5 min walk to the Downtown Disney . And it is really cheap compared to the other 5 star hotels nearby .

I have stayed at the ENTITY_Motel 6 on W ENTITY_Disney way , it used to be a red roof but has gone downhill a bit . Days inn at ENTITY_Ball and ENTITY_Disneyland drive was pretty good , right by the parking garage . My GF likes the ENTITY_Ramada_Maingate , its within walking distance . Try a site like ENTITY_hotels.com and see whats nearby and in your pricerange , they will have ratings also as will ENTITY_Yahoo travel and you can try http://www.travelpost.com/

It was in a safe area and had a pool for the kids and room service too . We got an awesome deal but we booked a few months ahead of time on line . The even had Bath N Body Works soap , shampoo and lotion in our room not the usual crap that hotels use .

They are very clean and relatively inexpensive - they have a great pool/splash fountain for kids - you can see the fireworks from the pool , you can walk to the gate , ENTITY_Mimi 's across the street -LRB- decent gift store with enough food to eat in the room for breakfast , etc -RRB- . You can park there and walk easily -LRB- maybe 2 blocks ... -RRB- check it out :-RRB- We love it there -LRB- we travel with a 3 year old - and have been going there since he was 18 mos old -RRB- - the kiddie pol starts at zero inches and goes to one foot only ! -RRB- - next time he 'll be able to go in the big pool ! http://www.hojoanaheim.com/
