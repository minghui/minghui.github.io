But I would recommend the Snooty Fox Motor Drive thru Motel . It is on ENTITY_Western_Ave. and 41st st. Just of ENTITY_Martin_Luther_King_Blvd. and Western ave. Good Luck !

The only things there are hotels , fast food places , and a strip club . It 's a pretty seedy area . The only way I 'd recommend it is if you were a business traveler there on business . Since LA is so spread out , there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING . Most people who come here tend to stay in ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , or ENTITY_Anaheim . In ENTITY_Hollywood , I recommend the Orchid Suites , ENTITY_Hollywood_Celebrity_Hotel , or Holiday Inn Walk of Fame , all near ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland . Another one is the ENTITY_Best_Western_Sunset_Plaza . In ENTITY_Santa_Monica , the ENTITY_Holiday_Inn_Santa_Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced . In ENTITY_Anaheim , I recommend the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson -LRB- HoJo -RRB- ENTITY_Anaheim , and the Candy Cane Inn . There is also a nice place in ENTITY_Burbank called the ENTITY_Best_Western_Media_Center , very close to ENTITY_Warner , ENTITY_NBC , and ENTITY_Universal_Studios .

I suggest the Custom Hotel . It 's still very close to the airport but off the main strip and in an area -LRB- the dividing line between ENTITY_Westchester and ENTITY_Playa_del_Rey -RRB- in which there are a lot of cute little restaurants to walk to , a grocery store , bowling alley , etc. . There 's a great restaurant next to the hotel called ` ENTITY_Hacienda ' that has good Mexican food . http://www.customhotel.com/
