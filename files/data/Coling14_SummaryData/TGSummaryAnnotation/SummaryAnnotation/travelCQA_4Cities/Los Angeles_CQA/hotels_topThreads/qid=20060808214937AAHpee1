We know the disney hotels would be the best option , but they are more than we want to spend . Are they any inexpensive hotels with great pools and maybe even a slide ?

They have almost every brand name of hotel imaginable around there ie Best Western , ENTITY_Marriott , ENTITY_Travelodge , ENTITY_Raddison , etc. . Price is going to be depending on weekend/weekday and when you go .

Just south of ENTITY_Anaheim on ENTITY_Harbor_Boulevard is a cluster of new hotels that are close to ENTITY_Disneyland , but a world away as far as prices go . There is an ENTITY_Embassy_Suites , ENTITY_Marriott_Suites , Homewood Suites , ENTITY_Hampton_Inn , ENTITY_Hilton_Garden_Inn , Residence Inn , Hyatt Regency . The hotels are all only a year or two old and are in an area with restaurants and shopping . They all have pools , but no slides . Most of the hotels have packages available with tickets and the hotel . After you compare prices , call the ENTITY_Disney resorts and see about packages they may have . Sometimes the convenience of being right on the property makes it worth staying there , especially with little kids . And even if you decide to stay off property , I would pay the $ 10 to park in the ENTITY_Disney parking . No little kid wants to have to wait for the shuttle at the end of the day ! And no mom wants to have to listen to the whining that follows ! Have a great time !

They have some deals depending on how long you stay . It gets my vote as the most value oriented quality hotel
