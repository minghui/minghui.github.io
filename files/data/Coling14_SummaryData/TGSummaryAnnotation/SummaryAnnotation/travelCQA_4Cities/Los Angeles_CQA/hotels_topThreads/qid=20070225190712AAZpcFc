Embassy Suites , ENTITY_Marriot , ENTITY_ect . Or you could stay in one of the ENTITY_Disney hotels . There are 3 of them and they are right next to the parks . Those are really expensive though .

If this is a once in a lifetime trip to ENTITY_Disney , go the extra and stay in one of the hotels in the park for the ultimate experience . You 'll be glad you did . Paradise Pier is the least expensive in the Park . If you 'll be in So . ENTITY_Cal for several days , ask your travel agent to get you the ENTITY_City_Pass . Discounted package for 3 days at ENTITY_Disney , 1 @ ENTITY_Universal_Studios , 1 day @ ENTITY_Sea_World and 1 @ San Diego Zoo or Wild Animal Park . Spend the extra you save on the ENTITY_City_Pass for a few nights in a Disney Hotel .

I know they are n't cheap , but they often come with packages that make them more affordable . And they really have it all figured out -- it is easy on parents and kids . Plus , you can schedule meals downstairs with ENTITY_Disney characters , come back to the hotel for naps , and have a ` Disney ' experience the whole time . There are indeed also a few hotels near by with shuttles which could be affordable if the ENTITY_Disney hotels are out of rooms or too expensive . ENTITY_Tripadvisor.com and ENTITY_Expedia have the best listings with reviews and maps .

'' Since rates at the 3 ENTITY_Disneyland_Resort are so high , you may be better off staying close by . Harbor Blvd , which runs between these hotels and ENTITY_Disneyland , is so pretty at night , with its trees all lit up with twinkly lights . All of the hotels are in good condition ; I 'd stay at any one of them myself . I have a web page that lists many of these Good Neighbor hotels , along with their amenities and contact numbers , plus links to their websites . The URL of this page is : http://www.family-vacation-getaways-at-lâ€? -LRB- Do n't worry ; I do n't sell anything on my website . -RRB- If you had a car , I 'd recommend the Motel 6 in ENTITY_Buena_Park -LRB- the 91 freeway , Valley View exit . -RRB- It 's always one of the least expensive hotels in the general area ... but it 's certainly not in walking distance . ENTITY_Motel 6 does have a brand-new location near ENTITY_Disneyland ; you could check out the details at http://www.motel6.com -LRB- I have n't stayed there yet , but it 's probably basic-but-nice , like most of that chain 's other locations . -RRB-

If you want to save money , you might want to try some hotels a little bit further south on Harbor Blvd in ENTITY_Garden_Grove and use the shuttles .

It 's in walking distance , but a shuttle to the park is included in your room rate , and it 's easier to take a shuttle than to walk , especially at night when you 're tired . http://www.candycaneinn.net/ I 've never actually stayed here , but the ENTITY_Carousel_Inn is right across the street from the ENTITY_Disneyland_Resort entrance and it looks like a nice place to stay . http://www.carouselinnandsuites.com/ Honestly , I think it 's worth the extra money to stay at one of the Disney properties , like the ENTITY_Disneyland_Hotel , but otherwise I highly reccomend Candy Cane .
