I live about 9 miles away from ENTITY_Disney . But I usually stay at one of the inns across the street from ENTITY_Disney every year and spend 3-4 days doing both parks . Basically if you choose a place in the 1500-1700 block of Harbor Blvd , you will be directly across the ENTITY_Disney main entrance . Their are many good ones to choose from , all are clean , reasonably priced and this area is so packed with tourists and families , that it 's very safe at any hour . My favourites - ENTITY_Carousel_Inn and Suites Park Vue Inn Desert Inn and ENTITY_Suites_Candy_Cane_Inn_Best_Western_Anaheim_Inn_Best_Western_Park_Place_Inn and Mini Suites The ones listed below are particularly popular for families - The ENTITY_Tropicana_Inn and ENTITY_Suites_Anaheim_Camelot_Inn and Suites Park Vue Inn Information for all of the above places can be found at the site below as well as ENTITY_Disney information too . While there are many nice places on Katella Ave , that claim to be directly across from the ENTITY_Disney_Parks ... I would not reccommend them for ENTITY_Disney visits . I would reccommend them for easy walks to the Convention Center . The reason being , that while it 's true they are directly across from the ENTITY_Disney_Parks ... What they do n't tell you is that they are not anywhere near the Main Entrance . It 's a good 5-6 block walk . Or , you can use the shuttles , which are very crowded at peak times and you will sometimes need to wait for a second shuttle to transport you .

I stayed at a Best Western and liked it fine -LRB- there is more than one Best Western within walking distance to the park -RRB- . There is an inexpensive shuttle that goes around to the hotels , so I do n't think it matters how close you are to the park . It is well worth it after a long day in the park even if your hotel is close . Before you book , call the hotel and make sure the shuttle stops there . Believe me , once you are there , you will be glad you did : -RRB-

ENTITY_Anaheim is full of drug dealers , pimps and whores . And by all means stay away from ENTITY_Santa_Anna . I lived in ENTITY_Fullerton for 15 years .
