You 'd be close to a lot tourist attractions and just a short drive to many other attractions . The train station is Union Station which is located downtown . Downtown is not a good area to stay in at all . The ENTITY_Hollywood_Renaissance_Hotel is on ENTITY_Hollywood_Blvd. connected to the ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland shopping/entertainment complex . There are restaurants and a ENTITY_Starbucks , there 's a subway station under the complex . ENTITY_Hollywood_Renaissance_Hotel_www.hollywoodrenaissance.com_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland_Complex www.hollywoodandhighland.com There 's the historic ENTITY_Hollywood_Roosevelt_Hotel right across ENTITY_Hollywood_Blvd. www.hollywoodroosevelt.com There 's also a W Hotel right down the street . www.whotels.com You 'd be near : ENTITY_Hollywood_Blvd. -LRB- the Walk of Fame -RRB- Capitol Records Bldg . ENTITY_Grauman 's Chinese Theater Starline Tours -LRB- forecourt of ENTITY_Grauman 's -RRB- ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland_Complex_Paramount_Studios -LRB- very good studio tour -RRB- Hollywood Forever Cemetery Other tourist destinations in ENTITY_L.A. include : ENTITY_Getty_Center -LRB- a must see -RRB- ENTITY_Griffith_Park and Observatory -LRB- fantastic views of the city -RRB- ENTITY_Universal_City_Walk_Downtown area : Union Station City Hall -LRB- go to the 27th floor observation deck -RRB- Disney Concert Hall -LRB- free tours daily -RRB- Our Lady of the ENTITY_Angels_Cathedral_Chinatown Olvera Street Shopping : ENTITY_L.A._Fashion_District_Farmer_'s_Market_Grove_Shopping_Center_Beverly_Center_Mall_Brentwood_Country_Mart_Fun and relaxation : ENTITY_Santa_Monica_Pier and Third Street Promenade ENTITY_Venice_Beach_Catalina_Island_Malibu You can check out ENTITY_L.A. hotels here : www.tripadvisor.com Here 's a site with information about visiting ENTITY_L.A. www.discoverlosangeles.com

Most people who come here tend to stay in ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , or ENTITY_Anaheim . In ENTITY_Hollywood , I recommend the Orchid Suites , Hollywood Celebrity Hotel , or ENTITY_Hollywood_Heights -LRB- formerly Holiday Inn Walk of Fame -RRB- , all near ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland . In ENTITY_Santa_Monica , the ENTITY_Holiday_Inn_Santa_Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced . In ENTITY_Anaheim , I recommend the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson -LRB- HoJo -RRB- ENTITY_Anaheim , and the Candy Cane Inn . There is also a nice place in ENTITY_Burbank called the ENTITY_Best_Western_Media_Center , very close to ENTITY_Warner , ENTITY_NBC , and ENTITY_Universal_Studios . I generally recommend that you stay at different hotels during your stay , so you do n't have to drive more than 30 miles to get to a destination . That may mean a couple days in ENTITY_Hollywood , and a couple in ENTITY_Anaheim . Note : Westwood is NOT centrally located .

ENTITY_Hollywood is gritty and very urban , although I do recommend you visit it . You 'll leave with a more favorable view of ENTITY_Los_Angeles if you stay in ENTITY_Santa_Monica . The area around the pier and 3rd Street Promenade is popular with the tourists and the view of the ocean from ENTITY_Palisades_Park is very pretty . The best way to get around ENTITY_Los_Angeles is to rent a car . Public transportation is inefficent and you do n't want to spend your entire time stuck on the light rail or a bus .

We 're in ENTITY_Santa_Monica right now and visited ENTITY_Hollywood yesterday , am so glad we are not staying there ... It 's very urban and quite rough on the main streets , not somewhere you can relax . Of course it depends on what blend of holiday you are looking for - constant busyness and site seeing around celeb ville then ENTITY_Hollywood might be better , or more relaxing by the sea and day trips to the sites , then ENTITY_Santa_Monica might be better . Yesterday we took a drive to ENTITY_Malibu -LRB- 30mns -RRB- and then went to ENTITY_Hollywood hills -LRB- fantastic views -RRB- and parked up and walked ENTITY_Hollywood boulevard ... we even randomly got ENTITY_Johnny_Depps autograph as his premiere was on ! Today we 'll relax by sea , then off to ENTITY_Disney tomorrow . We have hired a car though -LRB- if you do , you 'll need satnav -RRB- . Enjoy !

Hollywood is NOT that nice and you got ta make sure you avoid tourist trap motels . ENTITY_Google reviews b4 you book . ENTITY_Santa_Monica is def . the nicest of the places you listed BUT it 's not close to a train / metro station and it 's $ $ $ $ .
