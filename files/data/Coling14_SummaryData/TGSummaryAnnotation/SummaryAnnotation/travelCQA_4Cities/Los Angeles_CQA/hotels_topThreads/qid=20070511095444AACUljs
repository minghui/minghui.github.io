qid=20070511095444AACUljs_answer_1	1	qid=20070511095444AACUljs	2007-05-11 17:06:42 +0000	best_answer	 The best place to stay -LRB- if you are n't actually on the property -RRB- is right along ENTITY_Harbor_Blvd. . I recommend the HoJo ENTITY_Anaheim and the Candy Cane Inn . They are both close -LRB- ENTITY_HoJo is closer -RRB- , and less expensive than a lot of others . The ENTITY_Fairfield is a bit closer , but a bit more expensive as well . The ENTITY_Anaheim_Plaza_Inn is an older property , with larger rooms , still close enough to walk to ENTITY_Disneyland . Sheraton is pretty nice , too , but not really close to anything except the freeway . It 's on the northern boundary of ENTITY_Disneyland , but a LONG walk if you do n't take the shuttle . A little pricey for me . If possible , the ENTITY_Grand_Californian is the BEST place to stay , you wo n't forget it . It 's a bit pricey , though . Have fun !

However if you are driving , and do n't mind trading the convenience of being right next to the park to save some money , you should consider lodging in neighboring cities such as : ENTITY_Buena_Park , ENTITY_Fullerton , and ENTITY_Garden_Grove . All are within a few miles , are clean , and reasonably quite and safe neighborhoods .

We spent a couple days at the Sheraton , RIGHT next to disneyland a couple years ago and it was AWESOME . The rooms were huge and clean . It was n't super cheap , but well priced . The gardens inside were nice and quiet , there was a nice pool , and the staff was pretty helpful . Location is the best . I 'd recommend that from personal experience .

I am a bus tour operator that spends thousands of dollars there yearly . They are about a ten minute walk from ENTITY_Disneyland_Maingate , have an outdoor pool and hottub , AMAZING front desk people who can help you plan to go anywhere in the area , and fantastic rates . Oh ya , they even offer a free continental breakfast until 9am . Its only muffins and donuts , but what the heck . Its not the ritz , but for the price you pay it is pretty darn good . I can almost guarantee there is not another hotel withen walking distance that can beat thier prices . Look it up on ENTITY_expedia and it gets great reviews . www.super8anaheim.com
