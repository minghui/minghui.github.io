Most people who come here tend to stay in ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , or ENTITY_Anaheim . In ENTITY_Hollywood , I recommend the Orchid Suites , Hollywood Celebrity Hotel , or ENTITY_Hollywood_Heights -LRB- formerly Holiday Inn Walk of Fame -RRB- , all near ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland . If you have the funds , the ENTITY_Renaissance_Hollywood is great . In ENTITY_Santa_Monica , the ENTITY_Holiday_Inn_Santa_Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced . In ENTITY_Anaheim , I recommend the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson -LRB- HoJo -RRB- ENTITY_Anaheim , and the Candy Cane Inn . There is also a nice place in ENTITY_Burbank called the ENTITY_Best_Western_Media_Center , very close to ENTITY_Warner , ENTITY_NBC , and ENTITY_Universal_Studios .
