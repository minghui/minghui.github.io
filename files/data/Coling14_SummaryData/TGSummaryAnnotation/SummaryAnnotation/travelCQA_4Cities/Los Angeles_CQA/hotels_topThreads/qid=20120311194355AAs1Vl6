You can , however , probably find a hotel with a kitchenette so you could have a fridge and not do all of you meals at restaurants . Figure out what sights are important for you to see and then try to find a reasonably central location . Know that ENTITY_LA has some public transit but some of the areas you are most likely to want to visit are not well served by it . The website is http://www.metro.net For at least part of the time you will probably need a rental car .

Most people who come here tend to stay in ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , or ENTITY_Anaheim . In ENTITY_Hollywood , I recommend the Orchid Suites , Hollywood Celebrity Hotel , or ENTITY_Hollywood_Heights -LRB- formerly Holiday Inn Walk of Fame -RRB- , all near ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland . In ENTITY_Santa_Monica , the ENTITY_Holiday_Inn_Santa_Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced . In ENTITY_Anaheim , I recommend the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson -LRB- HoJo -RRB- ENTITY_Anaheim , and the Candy Cane Inn . There is also a nice place in ENTITY_Burbank called the ENTITY_Best_Western_Media_Center , very close to ENTITY_Warner , ENTITY_NBC , and ENTITY_Universal_Studios .

The minimum time to lease/rent any apartment is 6 months . I 'd advise you to stay in ENTITY_Hollywood . The hotels on ENTITY_Hollywood_Blvd. are fantastic . They are : W ENTITY_Hollywood_www.whotels.com_Hollywood_Renaissance_Hotel www.hollywoodrenaissance.com ENTITY_Hollywood_Roosevelt_Hotel www.hollywoodroosevelt.com Hollywood would be a great base for you . There 's plenty to see/do in the area and you 're close to many tourist attractions and places of interest . I should tell you . Hotels in ENTITY_Los_Angeles are expensive . The least you could expect to spend per day for a room in a decent hotel would be more than $ 200 . That does n't include your dining and taxes . Hotels also limit guest 's stays and few would allow one guest to stay 4 weeks . You 'll have to count on changing hotels at least once and maybe twice . Look into staying with one of the national chain hotel/motels such as Holiday Inn or Best Western . They 're usually resonably priced and they 're located all over the place . Some of the Holiday Inns will rent a room for a one month stay too . Just ask if they have `` extended stay rates '' . You 'll also need to rent a car in order to get around the city . There 's nothing else you can do , taxis are exorbitantly expensive , bus service is slow and unreliable and the subway system is very limited . ENTITY_Santa_Monica is a good place to stay . Right on the beach , the Pier and amusement park and the Third Street Promenade , but the hotels in ENTITY_Santa_Monica are very , very expensive beginning at around $ 400 per day for a room .

When you get to ENTITY_LA see the sights real quick , rent a car and head south to ENTITY_San_Diego which is a much nicer city . The only nice places in ENTITY_LA are expensive and posh . You 'd be much better off driving outside the city and seeing the nicer parts of the state .
