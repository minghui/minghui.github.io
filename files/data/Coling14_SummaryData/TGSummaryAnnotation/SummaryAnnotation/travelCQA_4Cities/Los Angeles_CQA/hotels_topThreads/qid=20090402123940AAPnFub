I recommend staying in or around the ENTITY_Hollywood area , Holiday inn Express walk of fame has rooms for 134.00 in you prepay your stay . see trip adviser link below . http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-â€?or try this place http://halfmoonmotel.googlepages.com/

Since LA is so spread out , there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING . Most people who come here tend to stay in ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , or ENTITY_Anaheim . In ENTITY_Hollywood , I recommend the Orchid Suites , ENTITY_Hollywood_Celebrity_Hotel , or Holiday Inn Walk of Fame , all near ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland . Another one is the ENTITY_Best_Western_Sunset_Plaza . In ENTITY_Santa_Monica , the ENTITY_Holiday_Inn_Santa_Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced . In ENTITY_Anaheim , I recommend the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson -LRB- HoJo -RRB- ENTITY_Anaheim , and the Candy Cane Inn .

But then again it also depends on how long your accually going to be at the hotel , because when I go on vacation , I usually just sleep at the hotel because I 'm always out sight seeing ! But I think you should stay at the ENTITY_Westin_Bonaventure_Hotel in ENTITY_Downtown_LA. . It usually ranges from 150-200 a night for a regular room , but prices vary as the seasons change . It 's not bad for the location , and is a really cool hotel ! Hope I helped !

You may want to look at places in the ENTITY_San_Fernando_Valley area due to the easy access to the freeways , like ENTITY_Tarzana , ENTITY_Woodland_Hills . .
qid=20090402123940AAPnFub_answer_7	2	qid=20090402123940AAPnFub	2009-04-02 21:55:18	answer	 If you want to have fun on your spring break do not stay in this area . There really is n't much to do around the area except some bars and restaurants with happy hour . There are freeways you can hop on to get to Downtown , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , beaches or other places of interest from the ENTITY_Downey area but you must remember that ENTITY_Los_Angeles if FULL of cars and traffic . If you do n't mind traffic then it 's alright to stay in the area-it 's safe and only about 10-15 miles from downtown los angeles -- besides anywhere that you stay in los angeles you will probably have to drive because ENTITY_LA is just so big . If you can find a good rate you can stay in the downtown area and take the train from pershing square to many places of interest -LRB- there 's also a metro station near or in downey -- i forget -RRB- . The Standard is pretty cool and they have a club upstairs that 's pretty fun . Hope this helps-enjoy ENTITY_LA_!
