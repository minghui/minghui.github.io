I will be going with my mother and we will stay there for 2 weeks . Right now I am estimating everything so that I can save money up for the vacation . I would like to have a place where there is a fridge , microwave , and a stove so we do n't have to eat out three times a day . I would also like a place where there are no maids . I 'm not a big fan of the thought that they can come into our room and take things if they want to . I have been looking online and see that you can rent vacation homes for around the same price as hotels . I was wondering if anyone has ever rented a vacation home or owns a vacation home that they are renting out . Is it a good idea to rent a vacation home ? Are there scams or anything ? Should I rent a vacation home or a hotel room ?

I have stayed in over 1000 hotel rooms and have never had anything stolen . If you decide to rent out a home , do it ONLY for a reputable company like VROB.com or ENTITY_HomeAway.com . ENTITY_Craigslist and any other service is likely to be a scam . If it sounds too good to be true , it 's a scam . If the place is 100 % used as a rental and the owner does not have any personal belongings in the place , I would consider renting it . I would not want to rent a place that has personal belongings in it . If you have a problem with a hotel , it is much easier to be resolved than if you are renting home . You keep posting similar items = are you sure that you want to go on a two week vacation ? I think it 's a pretty long trip for a novice traveler . For a first trip , I 'd suggest a long weekend that is fairly close to home . If you do n't want to do that , plan something for 5-7 nights . Some people do n't make good travelers . If you find out you are one of them = 2 weeks is a long time .

For that you would need to get into an `` Extended Stay '' type of Hotel . Those places may or many not offer daily maid service . But as for maid service , you can always request no maid service . But while I would n't just leave bundles of cash or your best jewelery lying around . Hotels are fairly safe if you are smart about it and aware of your surroundings . Vacation Rentals are often a good way to go . The big thing with them compared to Hotels is that they will generally -LRB- but not always -RRB- only rent by the week and may require a higher deposit than Hotels require . If you were to look at vacation rentals , stick with trusted sites and not sites such as ENTITY_Craigslist . One such place is ENTITY_vrbo.com -LRB- Vacation Rentals By Owner -RRB-

And they can actually be less expensive than hotels . The `` Extended Stay '' hotels usually have a fridge , stove , etc. . Most hotels are reasonably safe . But vacation home rental is a good buy in the right area .

Go thru a realtor for that and you should be fine . Ask what extra charges are like for sheets , towels . Recently we have used ENTITY_Airbnb and had pretty good luck with it in ENTITY_Holland , although they are everywhere a can save a lot of money . Look into it . Just type airbnb into your browser . ENTITY_BTW , never had a maid steal anything from us in a hotel room but sounds like you want a vaca home . airbnb has them too and no , I do n't work for them .

I would suggest airbnb.com or ENTITY_vrbo.com , they both have a good selection .
