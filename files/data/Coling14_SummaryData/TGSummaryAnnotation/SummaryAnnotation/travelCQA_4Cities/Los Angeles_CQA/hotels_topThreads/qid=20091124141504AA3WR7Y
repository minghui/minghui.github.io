Does anyone have any suggestions ? Thankyou .

I am going to assume that you will probably spend more time at ENTITY_Disneyland than at Universal so , if you are , stay at one of the hotels close to ENTITY_Disneyland . The ENTITY_Howard_Johnson is nice and not too badly priced . There are a number of other hotels in the area that are quite decent in a variety of price ranges . I stayed at the Sheraton Park last time and had an enjoyable stay there . I have also stayed at the ENTITY_Disneyland_Hotel and numerous others . Some were not too fancy but if you are planning on spending a lot of time outside of the room all you really need is a decent place to sleep . What I suggest is looking at the ENTITY_Disney_Resort website and checking out their vacation plans . Not necessarily to book a hotel or anything but it will give you a good idea of some of the hotels in the area and what they have . Since ENTITY_Disney generally avoids hotels with a bad rep you will have a list of hotels that are at least okay . You can also check trip adviser and other rating sites . Note , if you are going to spend several days at Universal then look at possbily staying at two hotels , one there and the other near ENTITY_Disneyland . If you are just going for a one day visit then stay near ENTITY_Disneyland .

It would be best to stay in ENTITY_Burbank or ENTITY_Universal_City if you 're headed there . If you stay in the `` Anaheim Resorts '' area of town , near ENTITY_Disneyland and the Convention Center , you 'll be in good shape for ENTITY_Disneyland . The hotels in that area are all very close to the park , and most of them offer shuttle service , so you wo n't have to pay for parking . It 's looks like a short walk from most of the hotels , but after a long day in the park , you wo n't want to walk all the way back !

It also has some large escalators , so everything is pretty much stacked up in levels . You can get almost everything done and see everything very quickly . ENTITY_Disneyland takes a lot longer and involves a lot more walking . You 'll be fine all day at Universal , but at ENTITY_Disneyland you may want to be within walking distance of a hotel to relax a bit . ENTITY_Anaheim is very safe .

Pick a town somewhere between ENTITY_Disney and Universal that is interesting and safe . For instance , pick a hotel near the beach in ENTITY_Huntington_Beach or someplace in ENTITY_Santa_Monica . Limiting yourself to someplace geographically close to one of the parks severely impacts your enjoyment of the so cal experience . ENTITY_Anaheim is rather boring once you get out of the house of the mouse and ENTITY_Universal is kind of alone by itself with no other sights in the immediate area . There is more to the ENTITY_Southland than the mouse and movies . Some Recommendations : - stay out of ENTITY_Hollywood after dark - Nearly any beach town -LRB- surf city baby ! -RRB- - ENTITY_Huntington , ENTITY_Redondo , ENTITY_Hermosa , ENTITY_Manhatttan , ENTITY_Venice , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , ENTITY_RPV , even ENTITY_Malibu . - ENTITY_Long_Beach is nearly the midpoint between your parks . Nice hotels on Ocean Blvd and great restaurants within walking distance . - ENTITY_Pasadena

Both are in walking distance of ENTITY_Disney -LRB- like literally less then ten minutes -RRB- . They are nice and clean . However I am a picky person and their pillows go flat easily , so I just bring my own . About $ 100 per night , which is good considering how close they are to ENTITY_Disney . This spring we are staying at ENTITY_Best_Western_Park_Palace , which is the CLOSEST , directly across the street . We 've never stayed there but from the reviews and what we 've heard from friends this is a great place .

I 've stayed at the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson 's it 's within walking distance to ENTITY_Disneyland . Parking is $ 14 a day at ENTITY_Disneyland , I think . At least it is at ENTITY_Walt_Disney_World ... http://www.mousesavers.com/hojo.html
