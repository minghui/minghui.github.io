If you have a sensitive car alarm , the percussion of the fireworks will most likely set it off . It’s hilarious how the car alarms accompany the fireworks . The mist pool is a great place to watch them on a summer night . Keep in mind it’s an older ENTITY_Holiday_Inn with an extensive remodel , and you have to pay for parking in their lot . However , the main feature here is the proximity to ENTITY_Disneyland , and the fact that you can check in if you are 18 or older . Not sure if you can check in at the Quality Inn , which would also be a good choice .

ENTITY_AAE_Hotel_Anaheim_Disney is inexpensive , but hard to find . You must book online to get the good rate.I believe there 's a Del Taco next door or across the street . It 's next door to Super 8 motel . But both are between ENTITY_Disney and the freeway . The ENTITY_Orange_Water_Buffalo is a house with bunk beds in the bedrooms . The kitchen , living , and dining rooms are communal . Not as close as the other two motels .
