We are planning to take a road trip with our 3 yr old to ENTITY_Disneyland -LRB- from ENTITY_Colorado -RRB- . We heard that there are ENTITY_Disney resorts that have trains to the parks directly . But nearby hotels seem to be cheaper . Is traffic and parking a big problem visiting ENTITY_Disneyland ? Where should we stay ? Thanks for your help .

There are lots of hotels located on ENTITY_Harbor_Boulevard , literally within walking distance to the ENTITY_Disney parks . They are much cheaper than the ENTITY_Disney resorts .

Many hotels in the area have shuttle buses that go to the resort , and there is also the ENTITY_Anaheim Resort Transit System -LRB- ARTS -RRB- . Personally , I prefer to stay close to the resort . Traffic and parking are only a problem if you do n't stay nearby . If you have the $ $ , then stay on the property to get the whole Disney experience . The Grand Californian is the best , followed by the ENTITY_Disneyland_Hotel and the Pacific Pier Hotel . None have `` trains '' that go to ENTITY_Disneyland . The Grand Californian has it 's own entrance to ENTITY_California Adventure , and some rooms have views of the park . However , you still need to walk to ENTITY_Disneyland itself . The ENTITY_Disneyland_Hotel requires you to make a short walk to the Monorail station in Downtown Disney , but the monorail no longer goes directly to the hotel . The Pacific Pier Hotel is on the property , but there are MANY hotels on Harbor Blvd that are closer to the park entrance . If money is an issue , I always recommend the HoJo -LRB- ENTITY_Howard_Johnson -RRB- ENTITY_Anaheim , and the Candy Cane Inn . Both are very close to the entrance , and enable you to walk back to your room if you want to take a nap or go for a swim in the afternoon . The Park Place hotel is certanly close to the entrance ... a bit closer than the two I mentioned . However , it is n't much more than a motel . Check out ENTITY_Tripadvisor.com to see the reviews of the hotels , and judge for yourself .

So I cannpt really give you one with a good price , but I would reccomend the ENTITY_Disney hotel because it is right next to ENTITY_Down_Town_Disney -LRB- a shopping center with a bunch of stores and resturants , and has two entrences to disney land -RRB- , it has Three pools , It is like a block away from the entrence of both disney land and ENTITY_California Adventure , and it has nice rooms . There is n't a lot of traffic there , and parking is not a big problem , and there are two trains there , one to take you to the parking , and one to take you to the resort . I would recomend that .

The cheapest of the three being the ENTITY_Disneyland_Hotel -LRB- in the mid $ 200s a night -RRB- ! I recommend staying off property if budget is a concern . My personal favorite is the ENTITY_Peacock_Inn_&_Suites , which is located about 3 blocks from the ENTITY_Disneyland_Resort . They offer a shuttle to the parks , so parking is not an issue . And they have great activities for kids , a nice continental breakfast , and a small , but nice pool . Their rooms are also spacious and include microwave , fridge , coffee makers , etc. . . and 2 tvs in each room - since the rooms can be divided by the sliding door and the couch is a hide-a-bed -LRB- sp ? -RRB- .
