I just looked up hotel prices in ENTITY_Irvine , and they are quite a bit out of our price range . We live 5 hours north of ENTITY_irvine , so it is unlikely to come all the way back after the concert that night . Our price range for a hotel is about 100/night . ENTITY_LA is a pain to drive through , so we need a town that is close to ENTITY_Irvine , where there are many hotels . The ones that are in our price range are disgusting . -LRB- tripadvisor -RRB-

The hotels in ENTITY_Irvine actually go down quite a bit in price on the weekends because they are mostly for business travelers . ENTITY_TripAdvisor only shows average prices not specific days , so I would go to ENTITY_Expedia and search for the actual date you will be there .

Or at one of the hotels in nearby ENTITY_Newport_Beach . The ones near ENTITY_Disney are especially clean , safe and cater to families . Also they are generally cheaper than ENTITY_Newport_Beach places . Although The ENTITY_La_Quinta_Inn and Suites in ENTITY_Irvine itself starts at just $ 89.00 per night , for the last weekend in May . If do n't mind a short drive down the freeway ... My choice for the last weekend in May would be to stay around ENTITY_Disney . For two reasons . 1 -RRB- You 'll be in an area that 's safe at most any hour . Downtown Disney is free to roam in and gives you some place nice to kill time in and grab a nice meal before the concert 2 -RRB- You 'll stay in budget and the drive is not too far from ENTITY_Irvine . About 12 miles . A few places with good rates are listed below.I have stayed in all of these .

You should be able to find a hotel there that 's not too expensive . The problem is that SoCal is pretty expensive in general . I would go with the ENTITY_Crown_Plaza_Irvine . I found rooms on ENTITY_orbitz.com , ENTITY_expedia.com , and crowneplaza.com . It 's a business hotel in a great location , so you will get a good price on the weekend . I priced out May 30 and 31 , and found rates for $ 88 . The reviews for this were all good , except for one person with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder -LRB- dirty glass -RRB- .
