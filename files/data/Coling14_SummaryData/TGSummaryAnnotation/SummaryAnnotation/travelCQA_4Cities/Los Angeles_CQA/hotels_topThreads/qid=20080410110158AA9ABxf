Then walk to ENTITY_Disneyland . Then take a shuttle to a hotel by Universal -LRB- like the ENTITY_Hollywood Inn Walk of Fame or the ENTITY_Hilton_Universal -RRB- , and you can just take the ENTITY_Metro_Red_Line subway to Universal or just walk , in the case of the ENTITY_Hilton . www.primetimeshuttle.com www.supershuttle.com www.starlinetours.com www.lacitytours.com

I know a lot of hotels and motels will offer shuttle service to ENTITY_Disneyland though -LRB- and probably to ENTITY_Universal_Studios , too -RRB- . How are you getting from the airport to your hotel/motel ? There will be taxis , and if you stay at a hotel , they may have shuttles to pick you up from the airport . Take a look at the hotel 's website before you go ; they 'll have information about their shuttle service . ENTITY_Disneyland 's website also has a list of hotels and motels near them , although those are probably all expensive . -LRB- I 'm cheap though , so this might not bother you . -RRB- Have fun on your trip ! ENTITY_Disneyland is one of the greatest places you can visit .

From ENTITY_John_Wayne_Airport , yes ... but not LAX . I know of no shuttles to Universal . ENTITY_Disneyland and ENTITY_Universal are far from each other , and only ENTITY_Disneyland is next to an airport . Closest to ENTITY_Universal in ENTITY_Burbank , I guess .

Was Billings booked up ? maybe if you stayed at the better hotels , they might offer you a shuttle to some venues . But I think you should look into a car rental -- stay away from hertz or avis -- they charge way too much . . Enterprise is usually cheaper . . your second option is to take public transportation , but public transit leaves something to be desired in the los angeles area , unless your going to the airport
