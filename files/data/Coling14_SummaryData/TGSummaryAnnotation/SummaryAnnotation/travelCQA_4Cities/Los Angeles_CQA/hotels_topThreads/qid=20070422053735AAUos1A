Its a good idea to place ads requesting what it is you need , some may answer your request with suggestions . Also , it is sometimes cheaper to rent a hotel for a week than an apartment . Super 8 has good rates -LRB- $ 64 per night -RRB- , free internet and ENTITY_Free_Continental_Breakfast . Also note that you may want to consider getting a place just outside of downtown because it will be cheaper . Lastly try expatriates.com . They have been very helpful to me in the past . The site offer information on most cities/countries . The site features real people living in these cities , this can help greatly . Good luck .

An extended stay is the best bet , look for area like the ENTITY_West_Side -LRB- ENTITY_West_LA -RRB- or the ENTITY_South_Bay . Quieter and less expensive but easy to get around the rest of the city from there . August is HOT here and those spots are the cooler parts of the city . I 'm in the ENTITY_Harbor area and it stays anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees cooler here , with a nice sea breeze .

You 're going to pay top dollar . maybe you could rent a timeshare for a week . I know there 's is a place in ENTITY_Burbank where you can rent furnished apartments by the week , but for the life of me , I ca n't remember the website . maybe hotels.com
