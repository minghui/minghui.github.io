ENTITY_Disney_Visa also has a deal for cheaper rates . I think around $ 149 a night . If you are planning on staying onsite : You can go onto www.disneyland.com to look for vacation packages . ENTITY_AAA also has packages . I think ENTITY_Costco and ENTITY_Sam 's Club might have packages too.If you plan to come often you can buy an annual pass . Then next year you can plan your vacation one month earlier that way you can still use your annual pass . They also offer cheaper room rates to annual passholders . You can also check Ebay for cheaper tickets . If you decide to stay offsite : Try to find a hotel off of ENTITY_South_Harbor north of ENTITY_Disney_Way and south of ENTITY_South_Manchester . There are a lot of smaller hotels there . That is nearer the main gate . They also have ENTITY_IHOP , ENTITY_McDonalds and a few other restaurants in close walking distance . If you stay here you will be closer to the main gate than the people who park and ride the tram in . My friend stayed at one off of ENTITY_W._Katella and she said it was a long walk to the park . Unless you want to stay at one that has a shuttle ... but then you have to rely on their timing . You can also get into the park off of ENTITY_South_Disneyland_Drive but that is where all of the Disney Resorts are . You could drive and park but keep in mind parking onsite at ENTITY_Disneyland is $ 12 a day Another thought is a time share . You can get free tickets and cheap stay but you have to go watch their presentations . Here are some websites to ones I found for hotels and motels on S Harbor : http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/laâ€?http://www.hojoanaheim.com/ http://www.discoverourtown.com/hotel/909â€?http://www.discoverourtown.com/hotel/444â€?http://www.discoverourtown.com/hotel/266â€?http://www.discoverourtown.com/hotel/350â€?I am sure there are more ... but thought this would help you get started .

I have stayed there quite a few times while visiting ENTITY_Disneyland . One room was able to accommodate my parents , my brother and I . They used to be right near the front entry to ENTITY_Disneyland , but now with the ENTITY_California Adventure expansion , there is a short walk . They also offer shuttle services -LRB- for the lazy -RRB-

They are both a step above most of the other lodgings , which are basically motels . The ENTITY_CCI and ENTITY_HoJo both offer superior rooms , service , pool , and value in comparison to the other hotels in the area . If you need a suite , you may want to check out the Towneplace Suites , which are a couple blocks away , or the Park Vue Inn .
