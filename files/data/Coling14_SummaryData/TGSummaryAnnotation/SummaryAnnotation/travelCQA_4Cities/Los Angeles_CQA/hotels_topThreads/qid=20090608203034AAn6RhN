My fiance and I are going on our annual ENTITY_Disneyland trip for my birthday next week , but this time we decided it would be better to book a hotel and go home in the morning instead of driving home after that long day . I want a clean place to crash at night and shower but do n't care about amenities or special services -LRB- except maybe a fridge and coffee maker -RRB- -- I 'm going to be in the park all day ! However , we are planning to make about 3 trips to our hotel throughout the day . That being said , our hotel should be clean , within 10 minutes walking distance to the park or that provides a shuttle that takes about that amount of time , and something budget friendly -LRB- under $ 100 preferable but not required -RRB- . Thanks for your help !

We did it twice and I ca n't understand why we came back the second time . Insanity or desperation , I suppose . We had high hopes for the ENTITY_Disneyland_Hotel . It was pricey but a big disappointment . The pipes banged loudly when people around us took showers , the elevators sometimes took more than ten minutes - no fooling - to arrive , we had to request a rollaway four times in five hours before it arrived .

I found that If you stay there the night before going to disneyland as well as the night of , it makes the day more fulfilling as you can walk to the park within 10 minutes there is food on the way , you can get there when the park opens and easily stay until it closes without the hassle of driving being involved .

It 's right next to a ENTITY_MiMi_'s restaurant and it 's within walking distance of ENTITY_Disneyland . It also has ENTITY_Castaway_Cove it 's a mini-water park . They built it in the Summer of 2007 , I think . Go through this site and get a discounted rate ! http://www.mousesavers.com/hojo.html

It may be difficult to find a hotel within the time you have given , especially if you want to be close to ENTITY_Disneyland . I would suggest going online and trying a number of different online booking sites . Hotels often have blocks of rooms assigned to these sites so you may find a room available and you can find ratings from guests as well . Depending on what day you are planning on travelling there are several hotels with availability next week showing although it depends on the actual day . I have stayed there a number of times however I can not recommend the ones I stayed at for next week since they are all over your price limit . The last ones I stayed at were the Disneyland Hotel and the Sheraton Park Hotel and I enjoyed both of them . I have also stayed at the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson and enjoyed my stay there as well .
