You cna audition for American Idol to know if you really are a good singer . Most of the people who make it to the top 10 get offered record deals anyways , but you have to be really good . As for now , I think you should work on a REAL goal -LRB- as in education wise -RRB- But at the same time , pursue your dreams . You know ? Dont make acting and music your first plan , make it your second . You dont want to spend 7 years unemployed trying to get into the business . You can show up at all the important celebrity areas , clubs , anything to get yourself noticed . If you can , you might get noticed . Not everyone is lucky though .

Anyways , SNAP OUT OF YOUR DREAM BUBBLE ! You think that you 're the only one that wants to become an actress ? Get in line ! You 'll just be one of the millions of other wannabes that say that wanted to become actor/actresses but end up living on the streets , prostituting themselves to make it here -LRB- it 's not cheap here ! -RRB- Plus , ENTITY_CALIFORNIA is n't the only place to do it . You can also do it in ENTITY_Toronto -LRB- BEST PLACE would be ENTITY_London , ENTITY_UK . -RRB- Anyways , I would start looking at education first because there 's no guarantee that you will be in actress in 3 months .

Each year about 400 of them make it in one way or another . All of these have agens and experience at it before they came to ENTITY_LA. . The rest continue to wait tables and valet cars . The odds are not zero but they are very slim . Have at least $ 10,000 in the bank before you come here and leave enough for a ticket back home .

They take your picture for $ 25 and you will be in their list if they need you . Realistically , I would start as an extra ... just get to know the business from inside , you will make contacts and so on . you can also make your own movie and hope you get discovered . If you are really good why do n't you make a video of yourself singing and post it on youtube ... if it 's really good you get millions of hits and then people come to recruit you . You do n't need to be in ENTITY_Hollywood to make it .

Although , you might have passion for but u need the work for it . Which is get a band together good sounding one , phone clubs , do a lot of shows every week , build a fanbase , promote through the internet myspace purevolume , and important is recording a good demo and contact other musicians maybe lables if it works out . Although if u do want to be in a band i would not say `` hollywood '' ... there are not good musicians man . Start at REAL places like ENTITY_Long_Beach , ENTITY_Hermosa_Beach , ENTITY_Glendale , ENTITY_Burbank , ENTITY_Pesadena , ENTITY_West_LA , but not hollywood ... no hollywood ... maybe ENTITY_santa_monica , jacks mannquin is from ENTITY_santa_monica . ANyway , if u want better luck with a stronger music scene , ENTITY_San_Diego . Blink 182 , Unwritten Law , Thousand Foot Crutch , My American Heart , ENTITY_Pierce The Veil , ENTITY_Waking_Ashland and so on ... all these bands are new from 2005 come from there ... for newer music go there but if u are really into making it Huge ... maybe los angeles , but its hard there ... anyway Good Luck , i am wanting to become one myself too . .
