BUT if you live in ENTITY_Huntington_Park , ENTITY_Los_angeles , ENTITY_South_LA , ENTITY_South_center_LA , ENTITY_Conptom , ENTITY_Watts ... ... Forget it !! The most important thing is DO NOT go around empty streets by yourself ... always use the crowed ones Ok

I myself live in ENTITY_Downtown_LA and I feel incredibly safe . Yes , the farther east you go in Downtown , the more homeless you run into . However , especially the Financial District , ENTITY_Center_City , ENTITY_South_Park , there is nothing to worry about . I walk around at night without issue . They are really rebuilding the area and its going to be awesome in a few years . Before moving to Downtown I lived in ENTITY_West_LA , and I do n't feel any less safe here . There are areas of LA that are n't the safest to walk around , such as ENTITY_South_LA , ENTITY_Compton , etc , but if you use your better judgment in situations then you should be fine .

I live in the out skirts of ENTITY_LA maybe about a half hour . I also have some problems but not as much as the city . It all depends on where it is you live but in ENTITY_LA you can live in the nicest area and still have the same problems as the rest of us .

The majority of crime here is between gang members . Let 's put it another way : Is ENTITY_London a safe place ? I 'm guessing the answer is that it depends on which section you 're in . And as long as you have a little `` street smarts '' , you 'll be fine . Well , the same thing applies here . Good luck !

As long as your building has a doorman and security you should be okay . But in downtown LA there are crackheads and junkies running about in certain areas . Other than that its okay . If you can you should move outside of downtown ENTITY_LA. . There really isnt much to do in that area either .

At night , I do n't walk around by myself , but I feel perfectly safe walking with my friends .
