qid=20060718135800AANdJy7_answer_2	2	qid=20060718135800AANdJy7	2006-07-18 22:10:09 +0000	answer	 The weather is why people live here , but if you 're more than 15 miles from the coastline then it is too hot . Of course it never snows here , and hardly rains much either . The winters are very mild , I mean 49 degrees freezing cold here . However the place is very crowed and the traffic is very congested . The schools are very poor because in many areas especially ENTITY_Los_Angeles half the people speak English as a second language . There is getting to be quite a number of people who speak no English . For real ! Remember with one of the biggest cities in the world comes pollution and nasty old SMOG , yuck . But if you know how to make money and you 're tired of breathing clean air , come on . Oh yeah , if you want to raise children here , now you must be able to afford private schools , or live in the best neighborhoods and that is gon na cost a pretty penny . $ I 've always called it home , just wish I could give it a better report .

I make a good salary but the housing is out of reach for most middle income families/singles and I will most likely never be able to buy a home here unless I move two hours away . Life here is very expensive so be prepared to pay more in car insurance , registration , rent -LRB- I pay $ 1300 a month for a one bedroom . -RRB- , and entertainment , people live on top of each other , you plan around traffic and I do n't find people that friendly . The weather is what has kept me here for so long . However , there are endless things to do . ENTITY_Long_Beach is a nice place to live and is centrally located within ENTITY_LA_County . If you can handle colder weather I suggest looking into ENTITY_Minneapolis where the cost of living is lower and you still get what a large city has to offer . Good luck .

ENTITY_Long_Beach is Part of ENTITY_LA_county , Is a wonderful place to visit and live too . Is beautiful , people is nice , is clean and is pretty close to ENTITY_Down_Town_LA. . ENTITY_Long_Beach is a great place to live . Yes CA is really expensive , ENTITY_Long_beach comparing with other cities is cheaper . And is not that crowd like other cities in ENTITY_LA. . Good things about LA : you will always find something to do . Parties , Cultural activities , Art presentations , Concerts , Plays , excellent jobs with good benefits and good pay ... you name it . You will find it there . Bad Things : Traffic , expensive , high taxes , earth quakes !!!! Like every where , some places are better than others , ENTITY_East_LA is famous because of the `` Cholos '' or la `` M '' and Other gangs . People says ENTITY_Comtom is a really bad place to live . ENTITY_Hollywood is too crowd and dangerous during the night . Good Places to live : ENTITY_Long_Beach , ENTITY_Orange_county , ENTITY_Newport beach , ENTITY_Torrance , ENTITY_Palo_Verde ... I would say all places around ENTITY_South_Bay are good . If you are seriously thinking to move to CA , go and look first , stay with a friend for a week and go different places , judge by your self . Is the best way . Hope this help you . And Good Luck !
