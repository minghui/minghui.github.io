I love the stylish nightclub scene , nice decor , good music , fashionable people and I obviously am going to have to be prepared for the inevitable crowd of guideittes that comes along with that type of venue , but are there any hipster clubs or clubs that are more `` white '' ?? I 'm not racist but I do n't like going to clubs where I am the only white person , its one of those things ... As I 'm sure black people dont like being the only black people in a club , hispanic people dont like clubs with no hispanic people ... Are there any hipster -LRB- but not too hipster -RRB- clubs ??? I 'm from a urban inner city myself , so I tend to identify better with those sorts of crowds

You have two strikes against you here : You 're a racist , and a hipster . We tend to dislike both here , mainly because hipsters tend to be self-centered , egotistical , and self-important . Racists can be of any color , and classifying others or basing your attitudes based on race makes you a racist . We can not control the crowds at local clubs . You should know , being from `` urban inner city '' , that the racial makeup of clubs , ESPECIALLY in ENTITY_LA , is going to be diverse . Some nights , you 're going to be the only white person there . In ENTITY_LA , looking for `` white clubs '' is socially unacceptable . If you 're really concerned about being the only white person there , take along a date . Or some friends . I do n't get the whole `` I tend to identify better with those sorts of crowds '' . Inner city crowds tend to have more diversity , skewing more towards non-whites . These contradictory statements just make my head spin . Time for a Dr. Pepper . -- Note to regulars here : `` Gino '' is a term used by people from ENTITY_Toronto , with various meanings , but basically means Eurotrash people/music . Which is funny , because that eliminates everybody : Does n't want black or Latino , nor whites . No wonder she 's messed up .

Try the ENTITY_Golden_Gopher in downtown LA. . I ca n't promise that it 'll look like an Aryan Brotherhood rally inside , but there are plenty of hipster scum types . Hotel Cafe ' , Echo/Echoplex , 4100 and Thirsty Crow are some places you might also try . For coffee ENTITY_Intelligentsia_Coffee_&_Tea is filled with hipsters .

Clubs : http://www.clubzone.com/c1/los-angeles/nâ€?I do n't go clubbing so take your pick and take your chances .

Have you ever even been to the city ? Whenever I go to big cities , I see the different colors compared to my hometown . Recently , I went to ENTITY_San_Jose to visit my friend -LRB- White , -RRB- and he 's the minority in the club scene . At this one club we went to , he was the ONLY White guy in the club ! That 's how it is and it never bothers him one bit . That 's how it SHOULD be . Judge people by their behavior rather than the color of their skin . I 'm a Hispanic and I 'm a minority in ENTITY_San_Luis_Obispo . I 've been the only Hispanic at many parties and such , and it has never bothered me ONE BIT . Instead , it seems to bother other people , yet recently , I 've learned not to care about they think . If they 're uncomfortable about it , that 's their problem . ENTITY_PS - We do n't take kindly to racist people AND hipsters . --------------------------------------- â€ ENTITY_Dresden , it 's REALLY HARD to believe you 're from ENTITY_LA , or even live in ENTITY_LA with your racist attitude . We all know you 're from ENTITY_Oklahoma . You can stop pretending now .
