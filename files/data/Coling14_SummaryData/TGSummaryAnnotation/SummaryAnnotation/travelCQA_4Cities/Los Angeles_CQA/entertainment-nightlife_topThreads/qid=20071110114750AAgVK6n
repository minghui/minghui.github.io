There are a few places to sit and eat along Main Street , but there is still room for people to get between you and the parade route . As these people will be standing , your view from the restaurant will be blocked . Most people who want a really good view stakeout a spot on the curb well ahead of time and sit and wait .

That area is raised a little and your view wo n't really get obstructed by people walking by . Your view might be slightly obstructed by a tree in one direction , but it 's worth not having to sit on a curb . Just make sure you get there a little early to stake out a good table .

People begin sitting on the curb HOURS before the parade begins , in order to get a good seat . However , the curb is very cold and made of hard cement , and this is not too appealing . Perhaps you could bring an extra blanket or two , keep them in the lockers until going to the curb , and then sit more comfortably while waiting . No restaurants are available for a good view , from what I remember .
