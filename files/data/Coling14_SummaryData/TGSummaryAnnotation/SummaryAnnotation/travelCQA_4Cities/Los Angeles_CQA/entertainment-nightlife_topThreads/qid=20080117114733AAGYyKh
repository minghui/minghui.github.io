We will be going from ENTITY_Long_Beach and thought it would be fun to stay overnight on the island , but from reading various reviews it seems hotels on the island are either prohibitively expensive or not exactly up to modern day standards . If we just went for the day , would we be able to do and see enough to have a good time ? We would also like some activity suggestions , which are worth the price ? Thank you !

You can see everything possible , including a trip to the interior to see the buffalo , have a lovely dinner , and take the hour ferry trip back to the mainland . As you said , lodging on the island is price prohibitive and substandard for the price you pay . If you do n't want to drive home after your trip to the island , then stay at one of the wonderful hotels in ENTITY_Long_Beach , which are discounted in the winter and less expensive than ENTITY_Catalina .

If you like the romantic stuff and like to relax then stay the night . They roll up the sidewalks pretty early and all thats open at night is romantic restauraunts and stuff . In my opinion , not really worth staying .
