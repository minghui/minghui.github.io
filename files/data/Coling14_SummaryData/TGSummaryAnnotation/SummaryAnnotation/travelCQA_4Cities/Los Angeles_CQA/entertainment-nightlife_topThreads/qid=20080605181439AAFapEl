Since that time it has been a neighborhood , section , approximately a council district whatever but definitely not a city ... though it was one for about 7 years ... This famous section of town has had an honorary mayor -- -LRB- ENTITY_Johnny_Grant who just died -RRB- who presided over openings , events , Walk of Fame presentations ... but this is totally honorary ...

As for places in ENTITY_Hollywood , I have a short list here , which does n't include clubs . Let me know and I can post the list of clubs : ENTITY_Universal_Studios : A theme park that grew out of a studio tour . And ENTITY_Universal_City_Walk is a fun place to hang out in the evening after your day inside the park . Hollywood : ENTITY_Hollywood_Boulevard is ready for its close-up , thanks to years of urban renewal and renovation . Enjoy the Walk of Fame , Entertainment Museum , Chinese Theatre and more . You can see a lot for free . The ENTITY_Hollywood_&_Highland complex has lots of shops and restaurants , and the ENTITY_Kodak_Theater -LRB- home of the Academy Awards -RRB- . I also like the ENTITY_El_Capitan theater , because it has been restored to its former glory . Sunset Boulevard : Perhaps one of the world 's most famous streets , it began as a route between the stars ' posh neighborhoods and the ENTITY_Hollywood studios . It runs from downtown to the ocean , passing through the `` Sunset Strip '' on its way . It makes for a fun drive . Along the way , you see a lot of different neighborhoods : Hollywood , ENTITY_West_Hollywood , ENTITY_Bel_Air , and ENTITY_Pacific_Palisades . When you get to the ocean , stop at ENTITY_Gladstone 's for Fish .
