I go to school in ENTITY_Westwood and I find it difficult to find things to do at night because everything is for people who are 21 + . Any ideas ? Particularly things in the ENTITY_Westwood or ENTITY_Hollywood area because I do n't have a car and do n't want to take a taxi too far . Thanks !

You do n't have to have a car , and they are a lot safer than going clubbing . Some of the coolest clubs are in some pretty dicey areas . I 'm not yer daddy , but be careful out there ! Here are a few places that have at least some nights that are 18 + . Once again , be careful : These places may be frequented by jerks who just want to pick up some pretty young naive girls for their own pleasure . NEVER accept a drink you did n't see the bartender pour himself . And it 's a good idea to go with someone who DOES have a car . You can watch each other 's back , and it 's just not a good idea to be riding the ENTITY_LA bus system late at night .
