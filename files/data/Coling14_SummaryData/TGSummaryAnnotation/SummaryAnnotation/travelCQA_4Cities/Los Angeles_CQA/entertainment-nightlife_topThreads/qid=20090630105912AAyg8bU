qid=20090630105912AAyg8bU_answer_1	1	qid=20090630105912AAyg8bU	2009-06-30 21:36:18 +0000	best_answer	 You do not have to live in ENTITY_LA. . You can if you want to , it does not matter where you start , or when you do it . It 's your offer , your chances , and your work . That 's the most important . If you have a lot of money or enough to move to ENTITY_LA , then move there , but move there not just for singing , but you will have to like the place itself , also try to come with a degree or a plan B just in case , which will likely happen , because becoming an artist is very difficult . There are more successful bands now , than singers in today 's industry , and indie labels just for bands not for singers , so that 's going to be a tough one too . They do n't audition . They get together , practice and write songs first , promote on the internet like purevolume/myspace , phone clubs or venues to play at , get a little van , tour the state and on . That 's how bands do it . And the most important thing for an artist is , to have good networking with others , and make connection . This will allow you more open space , and offer . But it 's going to be competitive in ENTITY_LA. . You either make it or u do n't , and the chances of making it are n't very high , do n't want to upset you . Good luck though .

The process , if you qualify , can take years . Sorry , but singing , acting , etc. wan na be 's are a dime a dozen in ENTITY_L.A. Simply living here wo n't give you any in road to the business . You already live in ENTITY_Toronto , the heart of the entertainment business in ENTITY_Canada . What 's wrong with starting you career in ENTITY_Canada ?

Give your voice a few years to mature , and then reconsider your options .

ENTITY_Zac_Efron lived in ENTITY_Arroyo_Grande -LRB- about a 3 hours ' drive away from ENTITY_LA -RRB- and he made it successful . Plus , there are lots of opportunities in ENTITY_Toronto BELIEVE IT OR NOT !! You are either just too stubborn or too lazy to realize that ! Gee , if it was easy and fast , then would n't you think all of us would be singers !? If you REALLY were serious about this , then you would do whatever it takes to make it big ! You would give up your friends and family and all that 's fun to spend time practicing and practicing ! Right now , worry about school . You really need to fix your spelling !

There are about 1,000,000 people here in ENTITY_LA already trying to break into show business . About 200 make it each year . The odds are slim . And the business is NOT like ENTITY_American_Idol where just anyone can audition . Most people auditioning are invited . And then they pick the person with an inside connection anyway . And unless you have a degree that qualifies for a TN Visa , assuming you are a ENTITY_Canadian citizen , it is essentially impossible to get a visw to work here .

To make a long story short , stay in ENTITY_Toronto and work on your talent there . It 's very expensive here , so unless you can find a way to make $ 30,000 per year and still go to auditions , stay in ENTITY_Toronto . -LRB- What is a `` famous '' audition , anyway ? -RRB-

Get a used school bus or motor home and start touring . Play any dive bar that 'll have you , from Thunder Bay to ENTITY_Wawa to ENTITY_Windsor . It 's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll .
