It is right off the Blvd. and I could walk up to the various sights whenever I felt like it . The main streets : ENTITY_Hollywood , ENTITY_Highland , ENTITY_Vine , Sunset , La Brea-are well lit and usually crowded . It is easy to catch a bus to take you to ENTITY_Venice_Beach or ENTITY_Santa_Monica . Also , you can walk to the subway and go to ENTITY_Chinatown , or Downtown , or ENTITY_Long_Beach . There are plenty of sights , tours-you are close to Silver Lake and ENTITY_Los_Feliz , -LRB- lot 's of clubs , movie houses and restaurants . -RRB- I live about 2 blocks from the ENTITY_Motel 6 now , and I still enjoy walking up to the Blvd ENTITY_esp on a Friday or Saturday night to see all the street dancers , tourists , catch a movie at ENTITY_Graumann 's 6 or get pizza . It 's not bad . Like any big city-be smart , do n't get drunk , have fun .

Honestly , I would worry about that more than I would worry about any actual safety issues in ENTITY_Hollywood . If you do n't mind spending $ $ $ , however , there are some hotels in ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_West_Hollywood that are really nice and near some of the city 's best nightlife -LRB- The Mondrian and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel are two -RRB- . You might like staying in ENTITY_Westwood , near ENTITY_UCLA , as you will get to be around a lot of other people your age in that area . Plus , you would be almost equal distance to both ENTITY_Hollywood and the beach :-RRB- Have fun !

Today it is just a dirty old run down section of ENTITY_Los_Angeles . Sure , there are a few tourist attractions like the `` Walk of Fame '' and the `` ENTITY_Lowe 's Chinese Theater '' , but for the most part it 's not really that nice an area . Hollywood has MORE than it 's fair share of prostitutes , weirdo 's and druggies . People watching on ENTITY_Santa_Monica_Blvd. on a Friday or Saturday night can be a blast , you 'll see things you wo n't believe -LRB- just stay on well lit streets -RRB- , but it is n't a good place to stay at .

The thing to do is read up about the place beforehand so that you do n't accidentally wind up in gangland . Any guide book will tell you which places to visit , - stick to those .

You would have much more fun at say . . the beaches in SoCal ! ENTITY_Santa_Monica , ENTITY_Huntington , ect ... a short trip to ENTITY_Hollywood for a day or some nightlife ... . maybe 30 minutes .
