Most schools in ENTITY_Southern_California are on their summer break from early June through late August or early September . Actual dates depend on the particular school district . It will be summer time here , and ENTITY_Disneyland -LRB- ENTITY_Anaheim -RRB- will be rather crowded from both the children out of school , and because it is customarily our vacation -LRB- holiday -RRB- season . Expect long lines for the more popular rides , and hot temperatures . Sorry , but I think you want the truth .

According to the site linked here March and first part of December are best times to go for low attendance . The weather is worst in August when it can be very hot and smoggy . Winter , Spring and Fall are all better choices . Usually in January the sky is crystal clear . We do n't get a lot of rain in So ENTITY_Cal .

August is summer for us here . The temeratures are high -LRB- 90 * + -RRB- . And , no , there are no holidays in August in the states . The next holiday around that time of year will be `` Labor Day '' ... September 1st , 2008 . It 's a good time , August , to visit the ENTITY_Disney playgrounds , although hot . Both ENTITY_Florida and ENTITY_California are very hot climates . Crowds will be thinner , thus better access to rides . 'Cause the kiddies are largely back to school . ! Have fun !

Try to stay for several days so that you can space your trip to ENTITY_Disneyland and ENTITY_California Adventure over several days . It will probably be pretty warm when you 're here , so having several days to explore would be to your advantage . Yes , kids are on holiday at that time ... so it does get pretty crowded .
