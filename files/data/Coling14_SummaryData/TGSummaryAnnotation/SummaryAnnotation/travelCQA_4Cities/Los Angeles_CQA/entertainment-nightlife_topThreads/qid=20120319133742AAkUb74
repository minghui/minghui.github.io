I want to move out there in a few years , but do n't plan on making a ton . Probably not more than $ 40,000-50 ,000 for the first chunk of my career . I 'd like to do something music related . I 'd also like to get a house somewhere in SoCal eventually , preferably in or around ENTITY_L.A. Where do all the aspiring musicians and non-rich people live out there ? Is it possible to get a house on that kind of salary ?

Keep your credit great and your debt very low , it makes a huge difference . Even if buying a home seems impossible , things may change financially for you in the future , but if your credit is bad , forget it . It 's going to be tough to start out in music making $ 40,000 , it 's very competitive , which keeps wages lower . Many non-rich people live in apartments , others sacrifice and work a lot to be able to buy a home . Some people are able to buy due to an inheritance , or maybe they get a one time big job that will make a big down payment . Good luck !

The non-rich young people all live with their parents until they graduate college and get a good job , or until they thrown out . The `` aspiring musicians '' ? With their parents , or out in the streets . When you say `` $ 40 - $ 50K '' , do you mean per year ? That 's an unrealistic salary expectation without some serious experience and/or college education . As an `` aspiring '' musician , you can not make enough to even pay the rent . They 're a dime a dozen out here , and I think I just got my Six Dollar Burger from an aspiring musician . You know what I mean ? Now there 's a difference between `` aspiring '' musician , and a REAL musician . The latter eat , sleep , and breathe music . It comes from their pores . They leave more musical talent in the toilet than most `` aspiring '' musicians will ever have . Seeing them at work is a thing of beauty . They are SO good , one of them can change a beat or chords , and the others follow with a mere nod of the head or a glance . THOSE people have a talent worth MONEY , where people will pay to hear and see them . You hear them on movie sountracks , on albums , because these studio musicians are so good , they can play anything you want . And no , it 's not possible to buy a house on $ 50,000 per year . You can rent for that much , but not buy .

The vast majority of the city 's residents are not particularly rich . There are nice areas all around where you could live moderately , ENTITY_Santa_Monica , ENTITY_Venice , ENTITY_Glendale , ENTITY_Anaheim , etc. . You can find aspiring musicians in most areas of the city from ENTITY_Beverly_Hills down to the projects in south-central . The ENTITY_SilverLake/Los_Feliz area has a very lively music scene with lots of bands who are often looking for replacement members . The neighborhood has plenty of hip clubs and coffee houses where live music is featured . It could be a good place for you . Hollywood could be an option . One aspiring musician friend of mine has an apartment in ENTITY_Hollywood , he makes ends meet by playing for weddings , bar mitzvahs , quinceaneras , receptions , etc. . It 's a beginning ! You should be able to get a house eventually . Think outside-of-the-box and look for fixer-uppers that you can buy cheap and work on remodeling during your spare time . Actor ENTITY_Jeremey_Renner began doing this at a low point in his acting career and today he has made it into a multi-million dollor business . You 'll be fine . Just do n't worry too much . Worry brings negative vibes . The important thing is to hold on to your dream and do n't let anyone discourage you !
