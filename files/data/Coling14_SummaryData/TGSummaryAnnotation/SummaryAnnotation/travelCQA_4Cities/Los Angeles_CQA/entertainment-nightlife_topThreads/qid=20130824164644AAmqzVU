You will find people from all corners of the globe , with people of similar heritage clustering into neighborhoods . This is a generalization , but I find that long-time residents and foreign-born residents of the city tend to be very warm , pleasant , and supportive . However , it seems that many recent transplants who have come here to work in the entertainment industry believe that they must act distant and rude to others in order to `` fit in '' . Before you move here , visit a few times , find some neighborhoods that you love , and take time to get a sense of the people living in the neighborhoods you prefer .

ENTITY_Jersey people are close and loving ? You know , the people I 've met from ENTITY_Jersey are FAR from that . Maybe these people are the ones that got kicked out , but every person I 've met from ENTITY_Jersey has attitude . Like , `` Hey , I 'm from Joisey , get outta my grille '' . I currently work with a very nice person from ENTITY_Jersey . She 's very nice most of the time , but that ENTITY_Jersey attitude seems to lie just beneath the surface , ready to come out on a moment 's notice . Here 's the deal with people from ENTITY_LA : They 're nice and friendly , and very laid back . Except when they 're driving . People love coming to SoCal for the freedom . You 're free to be yourself . That 's because we have this laid back attitude that let 's you be yourself . Sort of like , `` You do your thing , I 'll do mine '' . People sometimes mistake that for being `` distant '' . It 's just a casual indifference about things here . `` Live and let live '' , as they say . If you move here , you 'll meet lots of friendly people , but they wo n't go out of their way to invite you to their backyard BBQ . But just so you know , this will NOT be good for your music career . We have thousands upon thousands of talented musicians who can barely score a weekend gig . So your plan should be to go to college , get a degree , and THEN move out here . Otherwise , the finances just do n't work out . You need to make at least $ 35,000 to make it out here . In the meantime , keep practicing your music . Get gigs whenever you can . If you are one of those rare talents , then agents will seek YOU out . Look up people like ENTITY_Bruce_Springsteen and ENTITY_Frankie_Valli , among others , and you 'll see that they gained fame in ENTITY_Jersey , not ENTITY_LA. .

However , in ENTITY_LA , people are less likely to get really friendly to strangers out of the blue . They are not cold . Just polite and tend to mind their own business more than the folks in the east do .

Thus , no one answer can hope to be sufficient .
