Stay in ENTITY_London . Visit the ENTITY_US_Embassy in ENTITY_Grosvenor_Square to get official immigration information .

It 's beautiful there , the beaches are nice , they have all these great places to go , like the ENTITY_Hollywood sign and ENTITY_Melrose and ENTITY_Santa_Monica . It 's full of different cultures too because of all the different people who come . However , not everything is perfect . You live in ENTITY_London so you might already be used to it , but its pretty smoggy , the streets are a bit small , and its kind of crowded and dirty . Not only that , but its also quite dangerous . Although , I guess it also depends on where you decide to live , like ENTITY_Beverly_Hills or ENTITY_Laguna_Beach are nice and safe , but they 're also pretty expensive . Anyways , to really answer your question , should you move there ? I 'd say yes . But try to visit a few times and really look around before making your decision . I know ENTITY_Hollywood tends to glamorize it in the movies , but there is no city that is perfect

And if you want to move here because of ENTITY_Hollywood , it 's really not a big deal / : it 's only one little section that 's nice and the rest is dirty and filled with bums . But I love it here -LRB- : The scenery for me is the best . I love the tall buildings in downtown . I love the graffite alot . There 's some really nice fancy places here . But there 's also really ghetto places here . There 's some weird people here too . I know there 's weird people all over the world but I feel like la has a lot . There 's a lot of skaters here -LRB- just incase you wanted to know how the people are like . -RRB- But to be honest it 's not a big deal , but maybe I think that because I 've been living here all my life . I would need to know how ENTITY_London is like though , so I can compare to ENTITY_la. .
