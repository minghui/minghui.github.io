The most convenient by ENTITY_MRT The most expensive by taxi Off peak hours -- after 9am for most taxi for add . charges . Some taxi services is after 930am ... i think ... Bus and ENTITY_MRT got no add . charges .

The price would range from $ 0.65 to $ 1.80 for both . Taxi is , by comparison , far more expensive . However , it is more convenient to take the taxi after a late night 's drinking , like after 12am . Unfortunately , that 's also roughly the time that the peak hour surcharge kicks in -LRB- 11.30 pm to be exact -RRB- and you would have to pay 50 % extra . So , let 's say your fare amounted to $ 12.00 , you would have to pay $ 18.00 instead . Each time you get into a cab , the base fare is $ 2.40 . Of course , if you compare ENTITY_UK and ENTITY_US , taxis in ENTITY_Singapore are cheap .

But , the taxi would be faster than the ENTITY_MRT or bus . ENTITY_MRT is a lot more convenient . The best time ... Dunno . Taxi charges extra for past like 9 PM or 12 AM , not sure . Buses do n't run past 12 AM , I believe .

The Peak hours are 0630 hrs to 0900 hrs for ENTITY_AM_Peak and 1630 hrs to 1900 hrs are PM Peak hours for buses . ENTITY_MRT are much the same . Avoid peak period for buses at all cost . Take ENTITY_MRT at peak hours if you like to squeeze with others within a tight space . Taxi are not recommended if you are not in hurry . After midnight , the only transportation is taxi except for fridays , saturdays and eve of public holidays , where there are nightbuses called nightrider , operated by ENTITY_SMRT , which costs S$ 3.00 flat fee . It is cheaper than taxi but it is hard to find and frequency are 20-30 mins a bus . Take the taxi instead but there are surchages after midnight .
