Check the Sentosa website to find details . I think the orange buses are cheaper - if you get off at Harbourfront and go to level 2 and over the footbridge over the road to the bus depot , you can get the orange buses from there which take you into Sentosa . It might be $ 2 for the orange bus and $ 3 for the monorail - it 's been a while since I got either so I 'm not sure on prices .
