Me and my friend are going to arrive at changi airport in ENTITY_singapore at about 11:30 pm and i think there 's no way we could travel by land to KL at that kind of time . And the problem is , we only have 3 days to travel around . Do you have any idea on what express bus to take ? from ENTITY_singapore to ENTITY_KL to save time ? and from ENTITY_KL to ENTITY_Bangkok ? and from ENTITY_Bangkok back to ENTITY_Singapore ? We prefer to travel early in the morning -LRB- around 6-8 am -RRB- or at nightime -LRB- 10 onwards -RRB- to be able to save time .

You may even want to drop a place or two if not you will practically rush thru the countries and not see anything at all . However , if you want to take a bus to ENTITY_KL then try the following sites they have the schedule and prices . https://www.aeroline.com.my/ http://www.transtar.com.sg/ Travel time from the airport to the buses is about 30 min by taxi . From KL to ENTITY_bangkok you have to take a flight - travelling by bus would take you about 22 hours . A budget airline that links KL to ENTITY_Bangkok is ENTITY_Airasia http://airasia.com/ And coming back to ENTITY_Singapore you have more choices http://airasia.com/ http://www.tigerairways.com/home/index.pâ€?http://jetstar.com/ I would really recommand that you just spend the 3 days in ENTITY_Singapore and enjoy it rather then rush around all over the place . Or travel from ENTITY_Singapore to ENTITY_Bangkok direct and back . Have fun ... if you need anymore information email me and I will try to help .

SE.asia may seem small , but not really that small ... not especially if u 're crossing borders , and u 're at the wheel where u can decide to go faster or slower . budget airlines , aplenty these days . it 'd be the optimum choice to take . but still , u really need to re-plan your itinerary . 3days for 3 destinations/countries ... big mistake .

Do not visit ENTITY_KL and ENTITY_BKK in under 3 days , you wont enjoy and it would be a waste of time just staying in the bus . Keep to 1 place , choose either ENTITY_KL or ENTITY_BKK . If you decide to ENTITY_BKK , please take direct flight from ENTITY_SG to ENTITY_BKK . If you decide ENTITY_KL , take a bus to and fro .
