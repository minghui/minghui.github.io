ENTITY_Johor is the easiest place in ENTITY_Malaysia to visit from ENTITY_Singapore because its very near . It takes less than an hour to travel there . You dont need a bus provided by travel agency to go to ENTITY_Johor because there are few buses with numbers like 171 that takes you to ENTITY_Johor right away . If you want to travel to other parts of ENTITY_malaysia , however you need to buy bus tickets that do not cost that much , maybe about 20 ENTITY_Singapore dollars ? could be less or more , though .
