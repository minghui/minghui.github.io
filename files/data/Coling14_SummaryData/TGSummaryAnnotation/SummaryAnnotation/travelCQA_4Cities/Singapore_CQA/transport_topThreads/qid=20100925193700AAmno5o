Just like other transit hotels at ENTITY_Changi , anybody can stay there -LRB- transit or non-transit passengers -RRB- . Transit hotels are located inside the airport , before you can get to screening/customs . If you are planning to stay there , you 'll have to be prepared if you want to change clothes and stuff -LRB- have the stuff on-board with you -RRB- . You have to pass screening/customs to get to your checked-in baggage . And you can not get back in , unless you already checked-in and have your boarding pass for your next flight . Anyways , after you stay the night at the hotel ... you 'll go through screening/customs , then you go to `` lost & found '' department , then you check-in for your next flight the exact same procedure as you normally do .

We have 3 airport terminals , and the Ambassador is in each one of them at the departure lounges . It is a fairly budget set-up - non-frills . Has computer terminals . Do wake-up calls . So I think it will be a good option because if you do arrive around midnight , by the time you check out and head to the city , there is already nothing open . And in the morning , you 'll have to cope with the traffic rush . They have a website that you can check rates/book etc. . ENTITY_Changi is one of the best airports to transit . They have swimming pools , 24 hour restaurants -LRB- not like some places I know ! -RRB- , massage chairs , 24 hour TV at the transit lounge , shower facilities that 's free . It would n't be that bad to do without the hotel if you are on a budget .

Another trick is if you have check in luggage just leave it there , in the morning just go to the lost and found and get you bags as long you have the baggage stub no worries or after two hours call the lost and found and check with them about you bags and tell them you will pick it up in the morning . Cheers

Most passengers however find a cozy nook in the airport , and there are quite a few , to catch a nap . Then pay for the shower facilities only . T3 is bigger and less crowded .
