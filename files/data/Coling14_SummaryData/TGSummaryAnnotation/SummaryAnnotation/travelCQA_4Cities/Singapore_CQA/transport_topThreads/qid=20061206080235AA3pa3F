And you can take a taxi from ENTITY_kranji itself , do n't have to go to causeway point . If you 're going to causeway point , then u might as well take mrt to airport ? Do you really need to rush to the airport ? If so , take a taxi , however , do take note of the rush hour timing . You do n't wan na be caught in a traffic jam , and pay so much to reach the airport , and wasting your time . If you 're not in a rush , do take the mrt then , as it 's cheaper . Especially during traffic jams , the mrt works much faster than a taxi .

If you 're at ENTITY_Kranji MRT and by taking a taxi to the airport , the estimated traveling time will be 35 mins only and costs about $ 12 - $ 18 -LRB- off-peak rates -RRB- . This is the shortest route to the airport because it cuts through the country by using TPE to shorten the journey time . However , if you 're taking a bus from ENTITY_Kranji MRT to the airport , you 'll need to change buses 3 times -LRB- Bus no. 170 , no. 151 and no. 24 -RRB- and the whole journey will take you 96 mins . And it will cost you about $ 6 . If you 're at Causeway Point -LRB- ENTITY_Woodlands_MRT -RRB- , also known as the ENTITY_Woodlands_Regional_Bus_Interchange . Proceed to the bus interchange , board on bus no. 168 . You will travel for an estimated of 22.7 km before reaching your next stop . Alight at ENTITY_Tampines Ave 10 - after TPE , which is the 5th stop . Take bus no. 27 or 34 at the same stop . Continue to travel for another 14.43 km estimate before reaching your next stop . Alight at the airport 's basement , which is the 19th stop and you 've reach ENTITY_Changi_Airport_Terminal 2 . If you 're taking your flight at Terminal 1 , just take the skytrain -LRB- FREE service -RRB- from ENTITY_Terminal 2 will do . I believe for this travel fare , it will cost you less than ENTITY_SGD $ 8 . Personally , I 'll definitely take a taxi , firstly to shorten the time spent on the travelling and to have more time to settle everything before I set off from home . 2ndly is the money spent on taking a cab is not very expensive but the time can be shorten by a total of nearly an hour .
