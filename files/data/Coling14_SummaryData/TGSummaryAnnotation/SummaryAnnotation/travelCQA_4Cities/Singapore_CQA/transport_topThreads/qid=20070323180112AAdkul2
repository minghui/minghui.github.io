If you were to take a plane , you will need to reach the airport early and it will take you approximately 3-4 to reach K.L -LRB- inclusive of checking-in time , waiting , boarding and checking-out -RRB- . Not to mention , it is rather expensive . Even the shuttle flight will set you back 170 + + . A train will take approximately 6-7 hours and it may not be comfortable so it is not advisable . You can choose from one of the coach companies as below to take you to K.L in comfort . Most of the coaches will alight you at the bus interchange and you will need to find your way to the city area . However , ENTITY_Aeroline will alight you outside Corus Hotel in the city area . Ultimately , it depends on your budget and your preferred mode of transport . Hope you will enjoy your journey to K.L ! :-RRB- http://www.myexpressbus.com/express-bus-services-sg.html

Take a coach instead at Novena Shopping centre `` First Coach '' or look at the newspaper that the coaches travel to different part of the ENTITY_KL . Alternatively you can take a flight and take the speed train to ENTITY_KL , cost a bit .

When you combine the cost of a hotel + a plane ticket , we actually saved money ! The cars were clean , but the water was cold , and I did n't expect to have to get out of the car once we got going , but they do stop about 30 minutes out at an immigration checkpoint . They also served dinner . Nothing like a big plate of ENTITY_Nasi_Goreng at 11pm ! Here 's the website ...
