If you only have a backpack to carry , then take the train -LRB- it is much cheaper - slightly over S$ 2 but takes about an hour -RRB- You will need to change trains at City Hall station to get on the North-South Line and then at Dhoby Ghaut station to get on the ENTITY_North-East_Line . Take a taxi if you have more to carry but it will set you back by about S$ 20 and add a few dollars more if you want the taxi to bring you into the island . Otherwise , you can take a cable car or a Sentosa bus .

Very silly , but that 's the way they make money in these parts . If travelling by taxi from the airport , make sure the cabbie is going this way : Head towards the ENTITY_East_Coast_Parkway -LRB- ECP -RRB- towards the ENTITY_City . When you exit at ENTITY_Keppel_Road , you 'll find yourself traveling on Telok Blangah Road . From here , just keep a look out for signs pointing the way to ENTITY_Sentosa .

That will cost you est. $ 2.50 . ENTITY_From_North_Harbour_Front_MRT Station go up to VivoCity Mall . Just follow the signs -LRB- the monorail station is at the top floor of VivoCity -RRB- . The monorail -LRB- est. $ 3 -RRB- will take you directly to ENTITY_Sentosa_Island . That i think is the cheapest and easiest way of getting there . Good luck !

The cab fare would probably set you back by at least S$ 15 , the train ride S$ 4 -LRB- including the entrance fee into Sentosa -RRB- .

ENTITY_MRT Train -LRB- Fare around $ 1.50 -RRB- : ENTITY_Changi_Airport > ENTITY_Tanah_Merah_Tanah_Merah > Outram Park -LRB- take towards Boon Lay -RRB- ENTITY_Outram Park > HarbourFront 2 . Walk : HarbourFront > VivoCity Take the only escalator -LRB- near Candy Empire -RRB- up all the way till the 3rd storey . 3 . Monorail -LRB- $ 3 -RRB- : Take the monorail ~
