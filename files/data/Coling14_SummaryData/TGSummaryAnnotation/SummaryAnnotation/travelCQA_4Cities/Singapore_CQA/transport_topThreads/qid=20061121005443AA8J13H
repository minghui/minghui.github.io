If youâ€™re visiting ENTITY_Singapore for the first time , you should make sure you know the best ways to get around the island . One of the more popular choices is to use the ENTITY_MRT â€ but for other people , going by car , bus or taxi is also viable . 1 -RRB- By ENTITY_MRT One of the best ways to get around the island is to make use of the Mass-Rapid-Transit -LRB- MRT -RRB- system . This system is like the ENTITY_London tube system and is extremely efficient . You can get across the island -LRB- East-to-West -RRB- within the space of about 1 hour by traveling this way . There are two main lines â€ a North-South line and a ENTITY_East-West line that cut across the island , with stops along the new towns and major prime locations in the city . 2 -RRB- By Car Another convenient way to get around the island is by car . The are three major highways in ENTITY_Singapore â€ the Pan-Island Expressway -LRB- PIE -RRB- , Ayer Rajah Expressway -LRB- AYE -RRB- and the Central Expressway -LRB- CTE -RRB- . Make use of these three highways and you can practically get to any location in ENTITY_Singapore . 3 -RRB- By Bus The bus transport system is also very efficient . All buses in ENTITY_Singapore are air-conditioned and reach their stops with amazing punctuality . If you want a cheap means of transportation , the bus is the correct route to take . 4 -RRB- By Taxi Last , but not least , you can take a cab to any place on the island . This is a more expensive option , given that the average cab ride includes surcharges for getting on , tolls and other add-on charges . But if you want comfort and convenience , the taxi is the right way to go . Hope this helps - did I misunderstand your question ? Best Regards ENTITY_Gary_Hendricks
