If you bought the bunk-bed , then it wo n't be so bad since you 'll be traveling by night so you ' ll be sleeping . But if you bought the 2nd class ticket , then it 'll be bit sore coz the chair does ` nt recline . The ticket cost a bit more than the bus . http://www.ktmb.com.my/ 2 . Bus - It 'll take round 5 hours . It depends where you want to go in ENTITY_Singapore . Different bus stops at different places in ENTITY_Singapore . Below are few buses from ENTITY_KL - ENTITY_SIngapore_Transnational_Ekspress operates from ENTITY_Pudu Raya Bus Terminal and Lavander Street , Junction Off Bus Station Kallang Baru .

qid=20070429200807AAmK7Iw_answer_4	2	qid=20070429200807AAmK7Iw	2007-04-30 08:01:18 +0000	answer	 Well , I guess it 's personal preferences as well , but the bus will be the fastest . Especially if you get a super VIP coach from ENTITY_Pudaraya terminal directly to ENTITY_Singapore -LRB- which will take the Tuas border crossing -RRB- . As others have already mentioned , the train will take you 8 hours and the bus around 5 or 6 hours . But of course the train has its own charm and has the advantage that you can walk around , read a book , etc. . It is advisable to book train tickets in advance , otherwise you may not be able to get a seat -LRB- depending on what time and day you want to go -RRB- . And for bus tickets , try to avoid going on Sunday 's unless you have to be in ENTITY_Singapore on Sunday night . Sunday it 's hard to get bus tickets and you may end up having to travel to JB first and from there taking a local bus across to ENTITY_Singapore .

More comfortable . And , significantly more buses go to ENTITY_Singapore than trains so it 's easier to get tickets .

It takes 5hrs and you get to see the scenary . The train takes 8 hrs and unless you can sleep like a log anywhere , you will be dead tired cos it is really noisy . One of my friends even had a cockroach as a night visitor to her sleeping bunk - yuks !!

I commute quite frequently between ENTITY_Singapore and ENTITY_KL and definitely recommend the buses . If price does not matter and comfort is really key , try these bus companies : Aeroline -LRB- http://www.aeroline.com.my -RRB- ENTITY_Transtar -LRB- http://www.transtar.com.sg -RRB- Grassland -LRB- ENTITY_Singapore -RRB- I use these three due to comfort , safety , punctuality and convenient bus terminal -LRB- no need to head for the ever congested ENTITY_Pudu area -RRB- .

A train 's fine too , though slightly more expensive than taking a coach . Frankly , there 's not much difference whether you take a train or a coach to ENTITY_Singapore . Just check out the price differences , and see which you prefer .
