I would suggest any area near Bugis , City Hall or ENTITY_Little_India . The hotels near ENTITY_Orchard_Road are a bit on the high side . In Bugis area , if you are looking at cheap hotels , you may want to consider ENTITY_Bayview_Hotel_Singapore - quite a decent place , close to attractions . http://www.bayviewhotels.com/singapore/ If you want some adventure , book a hotel in ENTITY_Little_India , it 's a nice place , great shopping . . anytime of the day .

Among those not too expensive -LRB- between ENTITY_SGD 150 and 200 -RRB- , you can look at : YMCA@OneOrchard is good , with swimming pool . Great location . Gallery Hotel For something cheaper -LRB- starts at 105 SGD -RRB- , I recommend Harborville Hotel , safe , nice and clean -LRB- a bit farther the center , but easy by Bus -RRB- . But also used by hookers . Depends on what you accept your children to see . In ENTITY_Chinatown , recommend ENTITY_Royal_Peacock hotel . Very good location , hotel OK -LRB- around 150SGD ? -RRB- In any case , avoid ENTITY_Geylang area , which is not very nice -LRB- red light district -RRB- . You can stay in ENTITY_Orchard area , ENTITY_Chinatown , Bugis , or even ENTITY_Little_India . It is central and public transport is very good in ENTITY_Singapore

If you are coming with your family and not too fussy with having a very beautiful grand or classy hotel , then I would recommend Hotel Grand Central , a little old but deep inside the city with the subway nearby . This subway is actually the inter change of the 2 major lines in ENTITY_Singapore , so you can explore both areas easily . The other Hotel nearby is Hotel ENTITY_Haminton , a very small no frills hotel , location is great , value for money . Well for me I would just have a simple clean hotel and spend money on the sights and Food .

As for hotels , there are many and you have to state your budget to get a better recommendation .

Next choice would be hotels that are 5 mins walk from ENTITY_MRT stations as that is the most efficient transport in ENTITY_Singapore .
