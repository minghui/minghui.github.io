The one I took from ENTITY_Singapore to ENTITY_KL was in a nice electric recliner with comfy seats and only about twenty seats on the bus . plus it did n't really take that long . I was told by my boyfriends family who live in ENTITY_Singapore not to take the train because it is n't nice . We travelled in November last year , we just booked a couple days ahead and it was fine . Just make sure that when you go through customs you let them know you are getting back on the bus , otherwise they will take off without you -LRB- it happened to us on the way home , fortunately it was only a ten dollar taxi ride home -RRB-

You can book the bus ticket and board the bus at various locations in ENTITY_Singapore . However , I go to ENTITY_Novena_Square , 1st floor , take the green bus FIRST COACH which leaves ENTITY_Singapore every 2 hours and reach Bangsar Kuala Lumpur in 5 hours . And it costs only SD30 / -

A 24 seater coach would cost about RM40 one way . Would discourage car hire because i ever made a trip to ENTITY_Malacca , ENTITY_Genting , ENTITY_KL and Penang by car , even with 3 rotating drivers , we did not have enough energy to enjoy the time there due to fatigue - though it was a good experience to drive up all the way . But I think I would rather leave the tough job to the trusty uncles driving the tour coaches so that I can have real fun when I 'm at the destination .
