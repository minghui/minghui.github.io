qid=20080630072716AA9FGzt_answer_1	1	qid=20080630072716AA9FGzt	2008-06-30 07:38:10	best_answer	 With so many people in such a small space , it can get kind of chaotic and overwhelming for visitors , which can make it somewhat easy to get lost . Make sure you have a detailed map -LRB- and a map of the subway system would be also helpful -RRB- . If worse comes to worse , do n't feel bad about getting in a taxi . The drivers are nice and speak English -LRB- or Singlish , which can sometimes be hard to understand , but they can usually understand you -RRB- . You can also stop by hotels and other business and ask for directions . Singaporeans are really friendly and they generally seem more than happy to point people in the right direction . Oh , and because many of the street names , etc are hard to pronounce in English , it might be helpful to write them down so you can show people . But do n't forget , getting lost is often the best way to have a great adventure . Have fun !

Maps are good , the taxis are abundant , the public transport efficient etc Although the local language is usually Hokkien based there is usually someone around who can speak Singlish and all the public notices are in English . Normally the locals are happy to help - certainly better than ENTITY_US , ENTITY_UK , ENTITY_Oz_etc. .

No worries , ENTITY_Singapore is small and safe and crowded most of the time . Tourist attractions spots are easily accessible by trains , buses and needless to say , the taxis . If you need to visit other places instead of tourist attractions spots , you may find out more from your hotel lobby , they should know well .
