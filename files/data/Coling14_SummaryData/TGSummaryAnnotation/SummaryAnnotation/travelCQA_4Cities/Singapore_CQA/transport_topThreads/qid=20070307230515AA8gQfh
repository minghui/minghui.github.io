The ENTITY_MRT -LRB- underground or metro -RRB- serves most of the island . Buses are air-conditioned . Both the ENTITY_MRT and bus services are very safe to travel on , even late at night . When I was living in ENTITY_Singapore , I had no worries about my daughters coming home after midnight on their own . If your home is not close to public transport , get a taxi . Taxicabs can be booked via phone . After some trips you can make arrangements with the taxi driver to pick you from your home when you are going to the uni .

Anyway we have another foreigner to take up our beautiful space not knowing the beauty of ENTITY_Singapore , sigh ! If you are drinking at 1am and walking along the streets , definitely you need a driver to send you home . It is like anywhere especially a young woman walking after a drink any man will try to chat up with her . You should re phrase your questions as I thought you are taking a public bus after attending courses at our university not walking after drinking .

You can if you wish pre-order taxis to pick you up at your apartment and take you back at a fixed time . The charges are reasonable . An executive limousine service is also available from companies based at the airport but it is three times the cost of an ordinary taxi .

The public transport system comprising of ENTITY_Mass_Rapid_Transit -LRB- MRT -RRB- -LRB- or the `` underground '' as it is called in some countries -RRB- and buses can get you to most places and are safe to use even late at night . Taxis are relatively cheaper than other countries and are very safe too . If you can afford , then getting a personal driver is a good idea ... they cost about US$ 1000 - $ 2000 a month , depending on working hours . Personal cars are expensive though , a ENTITY_Toyota_Camry cost about ENTITY_US $ 55,000 . P.S. I just read the info under Additional Details . Yes , I agree with you , no country is perfectly safe . If you are drinking and walking in the streets at 1 am alone , you are asking for trouble . Take a cab home will be the best idea . We have a saying here - `` Low Crime does n't mean no crime '' .

And if you happen to ` meet ' a taxi driver whom you think can be trusted , you can ask for his contact number . I think he will be willing to be your ` driver ' each time you need his service . There are also lady drivers in ENTITY_Singapore . Hiring a personal driver in ENTITY_Singapore is not too expensive . I have a friend who works as a driver and his monthly salary is about S$ 1,600 . You have to add in the cost of car instalment , patrol , parking , ENTITY_ERP charges , etc , etc. . .

It 's really not worth to hire a driver , it 's about S$ 1200 per month . But you may need to buy a car . Car in ENTITY_Singapore is most expensive in the world . I own a car , if you prefer can write to me for arrangement on single trip from the uni to your home .
