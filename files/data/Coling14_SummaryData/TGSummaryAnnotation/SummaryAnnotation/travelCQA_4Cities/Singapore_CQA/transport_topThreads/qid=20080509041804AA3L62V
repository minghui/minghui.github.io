Hi , I am flying with ENTITY_Jetstar to ENTITY_singapore and am then connecting to ENTITY_Bangkok . Though I arrive in ENTITY_Singapore at 9:00 at night and leave at 6:00 in the morning . The Flight that I leave from is with Tiger from the budget terminal and therefore I can not go through transit . I would like to stay at the Transit Hotel in the terminal I arrive in . But what would happen to my lugguage etc. ... Would I just go to the hotel straight from my flight ... and then at say 4:00 in the morning clear customs etc. . Can you do that ? Please I really need to know .

What you read at the airport faq page is correct . 30 minutes after the luggage is not collected from the conveyor belt , the airline puts it with the Lost and Found counter . If you are using the transit hotel , do not clear customs . After your stay at the transit hotel , you clear the customs and collect your luggage from the lost & found counter in the arrival hall . It does make you wonder a bit whether your luggage is alright . But that 's the procedure .

Also , ENTITY_Tiger_Airways departs from the SBT and not ENTITY_Changi . You will be allowed to exit the SBT only if you hold a visa for ENTITY_Singapore or if your nationality is allowed visa-free travel to ENTITY_Singapore . There are no budget or transit hotels at the ENTITY_SBT and the nearest ones will be near ENTITY_Changi , which are pretty expensive , considering that you 'll be spending so less time . Give one hour for the immigration to process your exit and complete customs formalities at the SBT and another two hours for your departure formalities . This means , you 'll have only six hours in between flights . If you are allowed to exit the ENTITY_SBT , I would suggest you take a quick tour of the city in a taxi and return well in time for your flight . ENTITY_Singapore has some excellent night life and you can enjoy that during your breif break .

You can actually stay at the Transit Hotel , but better at Terminal 2 cause there is a free shuttle service that serve you from the budget Terminal to Terminal 2 . Once you stayed in Terminal 2 , you can either take the skytrain to Terminal 1 or 3 and thats easy . You can visit the city area if you are not sleepy and ENTITY_MRT is near Terminal 2 . As for clearing Immigration , yes at night the Immigration is more packed with clearing visitors but you still can make your way to the transit hotel if do n't mind the hassle and the amount of money paid . Its all up to you , my friend .
