These are available at all major book stores and convenience stores near the train stations or bus interchanges . It is a good idea to ask how `` recent '' the guide is as bus routes do change on occasion . When in doubt , you can plan your route by using the bus , trains and taxi guides available on the internet at the following web sites . Unfortunately , they do not have a one-stop transportation guide on the internet . At major bus stops , you can also find the bus guide of the various bus services available at that bus stop . Alternatively , you can also download the transport guide into your Palm/mobile phone if it supports this function .
