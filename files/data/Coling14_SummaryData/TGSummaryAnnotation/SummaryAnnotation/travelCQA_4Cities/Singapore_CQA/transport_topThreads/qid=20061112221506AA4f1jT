I understand that there will be a midnight surcharge for taxis fare after midnight . My questions are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- If I take the taxis at 11:45 pm and arrive at the hotel in downtown area at 12:30 pm , do I have to pay for the midnight surcharge ? -LRB- i.e. does the surchage starts when I ride or when I arrive at the destination ? -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- How many % is the midnight surcharge ? -LRB- 3 -RRB- Are the airport surcharge and midnight surcharge automatically reflected in the meter ? This is important because if they are already reflected , I do n't need to pay another airport surcharge and midnight surcharge on top of the meter fare . Thank you !

Most taxi drivers are honest and helpful but always be careful . Make sure the meter is turned on as you begin your journey , the meter starts at $ 2.50 and review the charges , which are displayed in the cab to avoid any confusion on the additional CBD charges . in case of dishonest practises , you can take down the taxi 's registration number plate & make a formal complaint to any police posts / stations . other than that , you may ask for the receipt . there 'll be an addtional 10 % of the total charge if you pay by credit card . have fun !
