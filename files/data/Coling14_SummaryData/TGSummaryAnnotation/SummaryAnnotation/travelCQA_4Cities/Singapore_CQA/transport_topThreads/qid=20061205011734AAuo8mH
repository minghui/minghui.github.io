Then take a direct bus 858 to ENTITY_Changi_Airport from ENTITY_Woodlands_Interchange -LRB- just below the ENTITY_Woodlands_MRT -RRB- . It takes about an hour . . This bus will stop at both ENTITY_Changi_Airport 's Terminal 1 and ENTITY_Terminal 2 . .

From Woodlands you can then just take taxi to airport . Bus fare less than 1.00 ENTITY_Singapore . Taxi fare around S$ 15.00 or so from ENTITY_Woodlands to ENTITY_Changi airport . Your absolute cheapest choice is to take same bus itinerary above . Then ENTITY_MRT southbound to ENTITY_City_Hall and change to Westbound train to ENTITY_Tanjong_Pagar_MRT station and change to ENTITY_Changi airport line . ENTITY_MRT - Flat fee S$ 1.60 max .

You can take Bus No. 170 from ENTITY_Johor_Bahru to Spore and drop off at Causeway Point at ENTITY_Woodlands_Regional_Bus_Interchange . 2 . Then proceed to the bus interchange , board on bus no. 168 . You will travel for an estimated of 22.7 km before reaching your next stop . 3 . Alight at ENTITY_Tampines Ave 10 - after TPE , which is the 5th stop . Take bus no. 27 or 34 at the same stop . Continue to travel for another 14.43 km estimate before reaching your next stop . 4 . Alight at the airport 's basement , which is the 19th stop and you 've reach ENTITY_Changi_Airport_Terminal 2 . 5 . If you 're taking your flight at Terminal 1 , just take the skytrain -LRB- FREE service -RRB- from ENTITY_Terminal 2 will do . I believe your travel fare will only cost you less than SGD $ 8 . Hope you 've a good & smooth journey !! Your travelling distance : 37.13 Km Estimated traveling time : 68 Mins

Then you transfer to the middle platform where there 's the ENTITY_MRT to changi airport mrt station . The cost is about $ 1.90 at most . It 's true that you also have to make many transfers to reach the airport though , but to me , it 's easier and you only have to move up and down the escalators only . 2nd Choice : I think it 's troublesome to take a bus to changi airport with many transfers of bus , and the journey time is at least longer than taking the ENTITY_MRT . Plus the bus fare could amount to $ 3.84 .

You have to tell the operator before hand that you want a SINAGAPORE TAXI only , as the malaysian taxis will not be able to take you there . Saves you LOTS of time and more importantly it 's convenient above anything else .
