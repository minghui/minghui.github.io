My advice to you is just remain in transit . ENTITY_Singapore_Airport is the most beautiful airport in the world , you will not feel bored so much to see from terminal 1,2 and 3 take the free sky train that links to all these terminals in transit just hop on . There is also a transit hotel within the transit area .

Your flight should land in Terminal 3 . Do check out the rates for the transit hotel at the airport . You should also take the free city tour of ENTITY_Singapore lasting about 3hr or so as your transit time is long enough for it . -LRB- do book early as they will stop the tour once they got enough people to fill the busses -RRB- There are lots of food outlet for you to choose from so take your time to explore the entire airport -LRB- Terminal 1,2,3 -RRB- . If you decided to venture out of the airport , you do need to fill out an immigration form . If I were you , I would just book the transit hotel -LRB- you would be tired after the flight ... trust me -RRB- and also the free city tour -LRB- Free ... why not -RRB- and just lazz at the airport . You flight departing to ENTITY_India should depart from Termainal 2 -LRB- if it 's ENTITY_Singapore_Airlines -RRB- . Hope this is helpful enough . Bye and have a good and safe trip .
