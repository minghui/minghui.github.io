The good thing about ENTITY_Singapore is that its incredibly tourist friendly . Its obvious for example when arriving at ENTITY_Changi_Airport how to get to the ENTITY_MRT station -LRB- the train line -RRB- or where the taxi stands are . Before you arrive you should check out the ENTITY_MRT map -LRB- linked below -RRB- . If you then know where the wedding is located you could subsequently also book a hotel nearby and ideally they 'll both be close to an ENTITY_MRT station -LRB- most hotel websites will state location vs. nearest ENTITY_MRT station on their websites -RRB- . That way you could save some money by jumping on the ENTITY_MRT directly from the airport . Its very well sign posted and obvious to work out which trains to get on and if necessary where to change for different lines . That said Taxis are also very cheap here relative to ENTITY_Australia for example . If you want to save pennies do n't jump in the white or black taxis as these are a bit more expensive .
