Of course , you can also drive there . But do check with the local rental car company of any restriction . Driving take about 4 - 5 hours , depending on traffic -LRB- especially on the causeway - a bridge link between ENTITY_Singapore and ENTITY_Malaysia -RRB- .

My advice is to just take the coach as it is the cheapest , and the time to reach KL from ENTITY_Singapore is only about 5 hours . If you take plane it still take about 4 hours to reach Kuala Lumpur , including transit time and the 40mins trip from ENTITY_KLIA airport to ENTITY_KL_Sentral . If you take the coach , you should consider `` Nice '' if you are staying at ENTITY_Mid_Valley_City . You can take the ENTITY_KTM komuter train to reach ENTITY_Mid_Valley_City from ENTITY_KTM station .

I 'll take 5 to 6 hours to reach KL . The bus station at ENTITY_KL -LRB- ENTITY_Pudu -RRB- is terrible -LRB- probably the worst in M'sia -RRB- so I suggest you just get out of there immeadiately after arrival .

It is cheap , about S$ 25 one way and takes only about 4 hours road trip . Take a plane cost a lot more and takes you about 1 hour flight time plus about 2 hours in both airports . If you drive , it will take about 3 hours anyway , so the coach does not take any much longer . Plus you just sit back and relax for the drive ahead . Try the Transnational bus company at ENTITY_Crawford_St. Bus departs hourly into the heart of ENTITY_KL .
