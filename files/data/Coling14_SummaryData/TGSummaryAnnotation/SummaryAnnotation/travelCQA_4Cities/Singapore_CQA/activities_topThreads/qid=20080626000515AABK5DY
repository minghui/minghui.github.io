ENTITY_Google for hostels , backpacker etc in ENTITY_Singapore and that should help . Fernloft is a hostel type place I know of and there 's the New 7th storey hotel too which is quite cheap -LRB- it 's being demolished at the end of the year but should still be open in September -RRB- But if you get completely stuck - there 's a place on the beach which rents tents out now . Next to the Beach Hut on the east coast park !
