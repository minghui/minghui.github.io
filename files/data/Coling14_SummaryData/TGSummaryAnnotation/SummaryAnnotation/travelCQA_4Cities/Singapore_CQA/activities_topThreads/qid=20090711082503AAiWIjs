'' they are just tiny hills . If you want to have a skyline view , you can take a ride on the `` ENTITY_Singapore Flyer '' . On a clear day , you can see all the way north to ENTITY_Malaysia , and ENTITY_South to ENTITY_Indonesia . Near to it , is ENTITY_Suntec_Mall , where you can find the world 's largest fountain . So you can kinda grab a local meal in the basement food court next to the fountain . The landmark `` Merlion '' and `` Esplanade theater '' -LRB- which we nickname `` The durian '' -RRB- is also there . All these are not too far from ENTITY_Albert_Court . Do drop by the ENTITY_Night_Safari , it is worth a visit . Yes the zoo is good , but the night safari is a `` must go '' . No point heading to Sentosa unless you are staying for a longer duration .

In the daytime you can take open-top buses found in places like ENTITY_Suntec_City and others where they will take you around ENTITY_Singapore . You should also try local delicacies like ENTITY_Hainanese_Chicken_Rice and Fried Hokkien Mee while staying here .
