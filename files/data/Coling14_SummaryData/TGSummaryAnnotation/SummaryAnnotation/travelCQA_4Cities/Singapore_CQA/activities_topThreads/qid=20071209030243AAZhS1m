Holidays , exposition / trade fair seasons like June , July , ENTITY_Depavali_Holidays , Why the holidays ? every accommodation in ENTITY_Singapore is double price , or you could not finds one unless you have booked three months ago . Best advise I could give you , check with the website of ENTITY_Singapore , or ENTITY_Singapore or tiger airways airlines website ? Because they will tell you which best time to visit , for the airlines mention , if they run a promo on January for March visit , it means those are the days when there is no trade or exposition happening , so hotels are cheap and not so much people in ENTITY_Singapore .

First quarter of 2008 , I would advise you not to visit during Chinese New Year as most shops would be closed , the streets would be quiet and it would be very boring unless you are visiting local relatives like the rest of us .

If you come just before the Chinese New Year , you would be able to watch the Chinese New Year decorations at ENTITY_Chinatown . However , if you stay on during the Chinese New Year , you would be bored like what the other person mentioned as most shops would be closed .
