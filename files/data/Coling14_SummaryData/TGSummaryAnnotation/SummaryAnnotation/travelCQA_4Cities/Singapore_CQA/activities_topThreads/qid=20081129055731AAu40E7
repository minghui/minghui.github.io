My husband and I would be staying 5 nights in Sentosa starting December 28th , and we would appreciate any daily sight-seeing plans/itineraries as we are bad in time management . We would like to visit the mainland as well . We like to explore new things and at the same time we hope for a romantic holiday together :-RRB- Thank you .

The Bird Park is well thought of but for me the ` ENTITY_House_of_Darkness ' is the only MUST SEE !! They 've turned the clock around for nocturnal animals in a very natural environment . ENTITY_Changi_Gaol_Museum is interesting and reverent . Stop there on the way to ENTITY_Pulau_Ubin . You reach ENTITY_Pulau_Ubin from ENTITY_Changi_Village by ferry . You can hire bicycles to ride around the island and see what ENTITY_Singapore used to look like . -LRB- No 2 Bus will get you to both these destinations from ENTITY_Tanah_Meriah_MRT . -RRB- On the way back stop at ENTITY_Sempang_Bedok at the ` Ancient Chinese Cusine ' Restaurant for the best and most unique Chinese food you will find . It 's directly across from the ENTITY_Post_Office . Take the ENTITY_MRT to ENTITY_Woodlands then an ENTITY_SBS bus to Jahor Baru . Take a taxi , -LRB- very cheap -RRB- to shopping , museums , food or what ever excites you . If you are Canadian or ENTITY_American check with the ENTITY_American_Club . I think you can get a temporary membership allowing you to mix with people who live here . The ENTITY_Polo_Club has good cuisine and great Ambiance . Good Luck .

Look for the dancing fountain with lightings . if you wish to go else where , take a train like the locals do to ENTITY_ORCHARD station , start your shopping there time is up to you I would said start from 12pm where all shops would be open . take your time there as if you like shopping , this woul be good walk all the way to suntec shopping center or take transport its just like 4 stops from ENTITY_Orchard , the train stop is city hall ENTITY_MRT and take the underlink pass , there are shopping there also as you walk thru it . Once you finish at ENTITY_Suntec , go to Marina shopping center then finally to ENTITY_Esplande , we locals call it the durian due to its shape . Day three start , you could take a cable car over to the side from sentosa and look for this Wave bridge and do some natural walking all the way to the end , its going to be hot so dress light and bring mosquito repelling . , Day four , go to the locals resident , the ENTITY_MRT is very easy to use , so you can check around the local area , places like ENTITY_Jurong , Toa payoh and others , justlook at the map and ask if in doubt , TRY the local food there , its way better and cheaper than in the city . ENTITY_China town also could be consider in your time in ENTITY_SIngapore , its just 3 stops from harbour front station , the station is called ENTITY_China town stn of course . ok enjoy your day here and Happy new Year and M < erry X mas . Oh ya if you in to pubs and clubs , try ENTITY_Clarke Quay -LRB- newly renovated -RRB- and Boat Quay
