In ENTITY_Singapore , if you 're into local delights and nothing touristy , head down to the neighbourhood areas ... a recommendation would be ENTITY_Ang_Mo_Kio -LRB- close to town -RRB- . It 's there where you 'll experience ENTITY_Singapore better ... 99.99 % of Singaporeans can speak English , so it 's no problem where you go . Public transports are everywhere , ranging from the ENTITY_MRT -LRB- train -RRB- to buses and taxis -LRB- it 's illegal to tout , bear that in mind so you wo n't get cheated -RRB- . And of course , if you really wan na go for the tourist stuff , just grab a brochure at the airport . -- A good and cheap hotel will be the one near Plaza Singapura ... very cheap rates , very close to town . I 'm sorry but I 've forgotten the name . Run a search xD
