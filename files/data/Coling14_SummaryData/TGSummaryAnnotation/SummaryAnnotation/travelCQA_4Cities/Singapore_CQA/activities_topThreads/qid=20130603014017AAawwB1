Budget hotels like hotel 81 and fragrance hotels are some of the examples , estimated to be around 80-100 sgd per night . If you like rainforest , you can visit the botanical garden which is free for the public and also the singapore zoo and birdpark . Alternatively , if you like nature beaches , you can make a visit to east coast park or pasir ris for free . There 's also bicycles rental and 24 hour cafes and shops for you to dine and unwind . You can even book a bbq pit or set up a tent there to enjoy a sea breeze of the night .

Hotel here are quite expensive , and the food as well . The cheapest hotel may be is about $ 50 - $ 70 per night .

Two weeks is way too long , one week or even five days is enough as ENTITY_Singapore is pretty expensive . No worries on safety as ENTITY_Singapore is very safe & transportation is a breeze here -LRB- :
