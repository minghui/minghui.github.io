It should be enough for two and half days spending :-RRB- Most tourist attractions -LRB- River Safari , S.E.A Aquarium , Adventure Cove -RRB- entrance tickets cost around SDG$ 30 ~ $ 40 and you can spend almost a day there already . Meals should cost you less than $ 10 per meal , even if you are eating inside the tourist attaction . Adding up the transport cost , it should be less than $ 100 per day . If you are low on budget , bus and trains are cheaper alternatives to taxis . There are some places where you can spend the day without having to pay for entrance , they include : 1 . Gardens by the Bay -LRB- lest the domes -RRB- 2 . ENTITY_Marina_Barrage 3 . Botanical Garden , Chinese Garden 4 . ENTITY_East_Coast_Park 5 . ENTITY_Sentosa 6 . Popular Shopping Centers -LRB- ENTITY_Vivocity , Nex , ENTITY_Orchard_Road -RRB- 7 . ENTITY_Bukit_Timah_Nature_Reserve_Lastly , hawker centers , food courts , coffeeshops provide cheaper form of alternatives to dining in hotels and restaurants . Have a fun time in ENTITY_Singapore !
