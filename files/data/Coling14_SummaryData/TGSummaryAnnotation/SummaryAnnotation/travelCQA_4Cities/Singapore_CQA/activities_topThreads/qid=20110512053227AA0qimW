The cheapest way is to utilized its bus and train system to go to popular places . You can visit Merlion park , ENTITY_Singapore Botanical Garden , ENTITY_National_Orchid_Garden and Esplanade Theater . For cultural and heritage with a shopping tour , you can visit ENTITY_Little_India and ENTITY_Chinatown . Do n't forget to go to Bugis street for additional shopping spree , the prices are alright since this is still a tour spot . If you really want a cheap shopping destination , you should go to ENTITY_Mustafa , you can find all sorts of bargain items there - the good thing about this place is that it is open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week so you do not have to worry when to go because you can always drop by during your free time . About a decent place and hotel , you can check out the hotels in ENTITY_Geylang , it is strategically located in between the city center and ENTITY_Changi_International_Airport . Bus stops and train stations are also accessible . You can also try ENTITY_DUKW tours and the ENTITY_Singapore Flyer if you want if you have extra money .

For 3 star hotels , there are several near the city and in ENTITY_Little_India , such as ENTITY_Santa_Grand . The ENTITY_Singapore_River / ENTITY_Marina_Bay area is worth a walk in the late afternoon or evening . You could DIY or if your group is big enough , consider a customised group tour .

They are known to be sleazy . Try staying in ENTITY_YMCA -LRB- 2 of them in S'pore -RRB- , or YWCA for the ladies . They are pretty inexpensive and free of bugs . Tourists like our ENTITY_Orchard_Road . It is our major shopping belt . Eat at any of the food courts there for a satisfying meal below SGD10 . As for places to visit , I would suggest : - -LRB- 1 -RRB- ENTITY_Little_India in ENTITY_Serangoon_Road - for cultural immersion and good shopping bargains ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- ENTITY_Esplanade , our landmark a.k.a. ENTITY_Durian - for performances and concerts ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- Financial Centre in ENTITY_Shenton_Way - breathe in the air along this robust financial settings , eat at the eateries here and eavesdrop to many money talks ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- ENTITY_Vivo_City_Shopping_Centre - the place where you can take a train -LRB- 3 mins ride -RRB- to ENTITY_Sentosa ; it houses also the ENTITY_2nd_National_Geographic_Society retail shop in the world , after ENTITY_London , although small but okay ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- Botanic Gardens - try to go there before 8am . There are various group exercises conducted by volunteers and it is free . Enjoy the serenity of the gardens and walk through the rain forest within . -LRB- 6 -RRB- ENTITY_Orchard_Road - of course . .

In ENTITY_Singapore , the thing is you just have to walk and walk , and try something new , that way , you would find many interesting things -LRB- like good places for shopping -RRB- . . Do n't worry about getting lost , people are nice and once you find a bus stop or the ENTITY_MRT station you 'll never get lost ! I 'm not very familiar with hotels and so on , but all I know is if you search for a hotel that is near a station or bus stop , it 's very convenient :D Good luck and have fun !
