It will take 30 minutes at least to go from ENTITY_Jurong_Bird_Park to Night Safari if not longer depending on the traffic at the time and how you are getting there . ENTITY_Jurong_Birk Park you could do in a few hours , 3 is possible or you should stay longer if you do have the chance . Better off going in the morning and then leaving in the afternoon . Night Safari has more things in a shorter amount of time . There is the train/trolley around it or you can walk . There is also several shows to see figure around 3 hours in the least . You would be better off doing the ENTITY_Singapore Zoo then doing the Night Safari leaving ENTITY_Jurong_Bird_Park to another day . The ENTITY_Stamford is a good hotel and right in the middle of town so easy access to everything . It is right next to a mall as well so that helps . Use the Bus/MRT if you can it is a good system to use . Taxis can be expensive in the end with all the costs . Universal is newly opened and the kids are out of school so it can be busy , expect at least all day there . It is catered more to teenagers/adults in many areas . Maybe one day for doing the rides and the second day for other things like photos , buying souvenirs .

I preferred the zoo during the day , the night safari is very regimented . Allow all day for the zoo , and another day for the bird park . Not much point driving in ENTITY_Singapore , excellent bus and metro system . Universal studios will doubtless be the same as universal studios anywhere . If your kids need theme parks then go to ENTITY_Sentosa which is uniquely ENTITY_Singapore . enjoy .

The ENTITY_Singapore_Zoo and ENTITY_Night_Safari are at the same place and you can visit them on the same day . One complete day will be needed to see both , -LRB- Singapore Zoo in the Morning -RRB- and Night Safari in the evening . Suggested time required : Jurong Bird Park : 4 hrs ENTITY_Singapore Zoo : 5 hrs Night Safari : 3.5 hrs -LRB- Tram Ride and Creatures of the night Show -RRB- We stayed at the M Hotel in CBD area and it is an excellent hotel , very close to vivocity mall from where one can take the sentosa express . Universal studios is simply mindblowing . Keep 2 days for it . One day for all the rides and the second day for photographs with Characters such as ENTITY_Marilyn_Monroe , ENTITY_Kungfu_Panda , ENTITY_Madagascar characters . Your kids are guaranteed to love it . In case of any queries , please feel free to get in touch with me at romitk611@yahoo.com I can send you the ENTITY_Picassa album link of our tour if you want . Regards Romit

The answers given will have enough for you to chew . My is simple not to worry . At airport check and get all the materials you want on ENTITY_Spore_&_Tours_&_Attraction . The counter staff will guide you on what you need . Best is purchase your concession ticket for those 2 or 3 in 1 on places you want to visit and save cost . Make sure you check at the tourist COUNTER @ Airport . All hotels can help too . If with ENTITY_SIA check with them in the plane on Spore .
