To me , I feel that Zoo , Night Safari and ENTITY_Jurong_Birdpark is more or less the same , you can drop either Zoo or the Birdpark . If you have the time you can visit ENTITY_Marina_Bay_Sands/Orchard for some shopping . Are you intending to stay in Sentosa ? If it is then it should be alright cos ENTITY_Universal_Studios is basically in ENTITY_Sentosa itself . If not , you might need to pay the entrance fee to Sentosa twice , once on Day 2 and once on Day 3 .

Here you can also take the cable car across the sea from ENTITY_Mount_Faber to ENTITY_Sentosa . You can also visit the Esplanade and the Merlion Park with the Flyer , then visit the many museums nearby , then travel to visit Botanic Gardens with its famous Orchid Garden . ENTITY_Jurong_Bird_Park is only one stand alone tourist spot by itself . You can also visit the nearby Science Centre after that .
