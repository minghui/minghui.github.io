I was wondering if there was anything anyone could think of that would be fun to do for my birthday -LRB- nothing involving clubbing or drinking or anything of that sort ... just something fun and relaxing -RRB- . I wanted to go iceskating , but the last time i went , my friend sort of got big blisters and i do n't really think she wants to go again . Also , my friend REALLY wants to practice skiing because she 's going to go skiing for real and for the first time in a few weeks . But , I 'm not so sure if they offer skiing at snow city just for fun . Do you have to get the lessons ? And is it even fun ? hmmm ... maybe we could watch a movie or something ? or eat on the eagle 's eye ? I do n't know . Does anyone have any suggestions for fun things we could do ? -LRB- there 's 5 of us -RRB-

But its costly and time consuming so its not avisable for a birthday fun but hassle rather . So i suggest u go for what u like . Actually all of them sounds fun so if u want u can go for skiing at the day time and movie at night if budget permits or playing paint ball instead of skiing will also do . If u only have night time , then movie will be great already . So this depends ur timing as well as ur budget permits .

What about Wild Wild Wet , or renting a chalet at one of the costa sands places and having a BBQ with your friends , or you could go ghost hunting at the old ENTITY_Changi_Hospital ! Or you could get tickets for the Flyer and then go for dinner at ENTITY_Lau_Pa Sat . I 'm not sure about Snow city , their website will probably say if they do skiing lessons .
