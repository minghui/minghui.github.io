Check out Quality Hotel , Peacock Hotel ... Food costs around $ 10 - $ 15 a meal for hawker fare or in any air-conditioned food courts . Do check out http://www.yoursingapore.com/content/traâ€?This website will give u all the info u need on which attraction to visit . I think that the Zoo is no biggie , nothing fancy . Visit heritage sites instead , and just take in all the local food . Food here is clean and almost everyone speaks english . Oh yes , by the way , some budget hotels may be $ 50 - $ 80 , cheap accomodation = but the areas surrounding it may be quite sleazy or ` red-light district ' ... Enjoy !

Take a look at this link : http://www.booking.com/district/sg/singaâ€?Most meals at a food court will cost 3-4 S$ . Beer is expensive at 5-6 S$ but fruit juices will be 1-2 S$ .
