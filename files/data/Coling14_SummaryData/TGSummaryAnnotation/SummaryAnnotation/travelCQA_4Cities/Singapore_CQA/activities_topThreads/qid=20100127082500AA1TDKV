There 's the zoo , sentosa , the ENTITY_singapore flyer , marina barrage -LRB- which i think is funny , considering that the water inside of it looks much dirtier than the water outside , check it out -RRB- if you do n't mind food centers without airconditioning , you can always visit the hawker centers located everywhere

All the tourist maps will have these areas on them It 's also good to have a walk around ENTITY_Orchard_Road and see the big malls , but as someone else says , it 's expensive , but you can do some good window shopping and things . I also like to take my visitors to ENTITY_Little_India , ENTITY_Arab_Street and ENTITY_Chinatown -LRB- the ENTITY_Chinese_Heritage_Museum is interesting -RRB- . There are a couple of tourist buses you can go on too which give you a sightseeing tour around the city and some of the airlines will get you a discount with your boarding pass so it 's worth checking that . Universal studios on Sentosa might be open by then , but ENTITY_Sentosa itself is quite interesting . If you 're into the war stuff , then ENTITY_Changi museum , ENTITY_Fort_Canning_Battle_Box and ENTITY_Fort_Siloso on Sentosa are worth a look around . Also the ENTITY_Singapore Flyer is good - you get a discount I believe if you are a tourist -LRB- have to take your passport and boarding card though I imagine -RRB- Go to the tourist information place on Orchard Road when you arrive , there 's lots of info there

The ENTITY_Singapore_Zoo is the best I 've been to in the world . The Botanical Gardens and ENTITY_Jurong_Bird_Park are lovely . There 's tons of great restaurants are the Quays -LRB- ENTITY_Clark and River Boat -RRB- Some other top things to do in ENTITY_Singapore can be found in the link below .
