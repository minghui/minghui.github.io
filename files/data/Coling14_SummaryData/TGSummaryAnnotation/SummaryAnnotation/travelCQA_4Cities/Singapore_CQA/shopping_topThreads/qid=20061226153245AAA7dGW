But if your wanted the thicker type , you should be able to find it at those shops at bras basah selling art & craft supplies -LRB- rather cheaply -RRB- , you be surprise the variety of `` brown paper '' they have ... Another alternative you can try , check out the nearest SingPost outlets first . They sell some poster paper that is brown in colour which you can buy by the meters ... save you a trip to bras basah if that meets your requirement .
