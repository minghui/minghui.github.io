This is link to the ENTITY_Singapore expatriots forum , which is for folks like you to ask all kinds of stuff about living in ENTITY_Singapore . I did a search for ` large shoes ' and got quite a few hits . I 'm linking you to the main site , the first search , in the beauty & health section , and then the results of one search , which mention 2 shoe stores , ENTITY_Charles_&_Keith , and Pedal Works . Anyway , this site might come in really handy for you for all kinds of things . I like forums because you carry on a conversation .

I know the ENTITY_U.S. stores stock shoes of a wide range of sizes . The ENTITY_Singapore store probably does the same - even if they do n't , it might be possible to order the size you want through them . You can try ENTITY_Clarks shoes too . You can probably find these at ENTITY_Bata . Good luck !
