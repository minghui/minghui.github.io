For clothes and shoes , you 'll love Far East Plaza , and you might want to check out Bugis Street too -- tons of little boutiquey-type shops and stalls , all selling very reasonably priced , trendy , and original stuff . For electronics -LRB- cameras , music players etc -RRB- , go to Lucky Plaza or ENTITY_Sim_Lin_Square . For home decor items , you might like ENTITY_Holland_Village -LRB- ENTITY_Lims in particular , but there are a lot of other little shops with the same sort of stuff . -RRB- ENTITY_Holland_Village also has an expat feel , so you 'll find things that cater more to the expat population . You might also want to check out the areas around ENTITY_Chinatown , ENTITY_Little_India , and ENTITY_Arab_Street for souvenir-type presents to bring home to people -LRB- there are lots of 3-for - $ 10 shops that sell miniature buddhas , fridge magnets , silk purses etc. -RRB- It is n't CHEAP , necessarily , but ENTITY_Orchard_Road has pretty much any shop you 'd find in the West -LRB- Gap , ENTITY_Zara , ENTITY_Marks_&_Spencers , Borders , Mango , ENTITY_TopShop , Forever 21 etc -RRB- , and you 'll find the same sorts of places in the big shopping malls like ENTITY_Vivocity , ENTITY_SunTec_City , and ENTITY_Wisma_Atria . Hope that helps -- have fun shopping ! -- ENTITY_Holly
