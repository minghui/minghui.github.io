As for shopping , you should go to Orchard Rd. -LRB- depends on your budget , you can visit all the shopping complex along ENTITY_Orchard_Rd_-RRB-_Best to go during weekdays and not weekends . If you have time , you should go to ENTITY_Sentosa_Island too . You need to go to World Trade Center to reach there . ENTITY_Singapore is a very strict but beautiful country . No drugs and chewing gum allowed . Happy holiday .

Serangoon -LRB- also known as ENTITY_Little_India -RRB- is an ENTITY_Indian_Town . ENTITY_Mustafa_Centre is a very huge shopping mall that is owned by an Indian . They know all your needs . A must go place for Indians . But of course you need to go and tour around other parts of ENTITY_Singapore like ENTITY_Orchard_Road -LRB- a must go place but things may be more expensive -RRB- , and Sentosa for some fun . Other shopping centres are more for locals as there are nothing much special . But you can go ENTITY_Sim_Lim to compare prices for electronics . And remember to bargain for lower price ! They will tell you higher price when they know that you are a tourist . For party till dawn , try not to wear saree as the place may be very crowded . It will be best to wear something comfortable and simple . ENTITY_Usual_Singapore_girls will wear pants with tank tops or sexy dresses .
