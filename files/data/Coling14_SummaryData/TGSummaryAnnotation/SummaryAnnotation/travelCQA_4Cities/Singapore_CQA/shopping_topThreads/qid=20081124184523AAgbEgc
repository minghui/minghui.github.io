If you intend to eat out everyday and are fine with eating at hawker centre or food court , then you will probably spend about $ 150 to $ 300 a month . If you prefer to eat at restaurants , then will be $ 300 to $ 700 . What is a hawker centre ? Check out here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centâ€?Mobile - If you 're buying prepaid mobile card , check this out http://home.singtel.com/upload_hub/consuâ€?Electricity - Usually room renting will include the electricity bill , but it also depends on the owner . Maybe you may need to fork out $ 50 for it . Internet bill - There 's a way you do n't have to spend a single cent on it . If you have a laptop , go to ENTITY_Starbucks or the ENTITY_National_Library and use the wireless connection , you just have to sign up an account from the web given , which it 's free . Other than that , you can sign up and buy an internet modem from ENTITY_Singtel , ENTITY_Starhub , or Pacific Net . I think the modem cost about $ 120 or maybe less than that . After that , every month you have to pay for whatever plan you signed , range from $ 25 to $ 150 . Night clubs - Eh , I do n't club . But if you 're that kind who clubs once a week , I guess $ 250 for a month should be enough . ENTITY_Transportation - $ 100 to $ 200 , remember to purchase an EZ-Link card . For more information , go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EZ-link The cost of dress - from $ 20 to $ 1000 + -LRB- If you 're brand conscious and money 's not a problem -RRB- .
