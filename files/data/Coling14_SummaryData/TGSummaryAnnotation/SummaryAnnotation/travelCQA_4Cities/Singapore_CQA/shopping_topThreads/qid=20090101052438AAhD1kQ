Just been there in July ,2008 -LRB- for a one month holiday -RRB- . Comparing with 2005 -LRB- I was there for a 2 weeks holiday -RRB- things are getting 3 to 4 times dearer . If you just want to do some sightseeing , consider all accommodation and flight tickets are paid , you need roughly ? 400 - ? 600 -LRB- around HK$ 4,400-6 ,600 in today 's rate -RRB- for a 4 nights stay . The money is just for food , transport , small souvenirs etc. . But if you want to do a bit of shopping like buying the latest gadgets , you need to have a bigger budget .

If so , you bring slightly more than $ 1,000 / - would be sufficient . But beware , do not buy any jewellery or traditional ENTITY_Chinese medicine when the tour guide brings you to these shops , you will be ` slaughtered ' if you buy . If you are going on your own , try to stay at ENTITY_Kowloon instead of ENTITY_Hongkong , ENTITY_Kowloon have more cheaper hotels . If you can eat local ENTITY_Chinese food , go to small eating houses you can get cheap and tasty food . For shopping , I recommend you to . visit the famous ` Ladies Street ' which is located at ENTITY_Mongkok district . take ENTITY_MTR there follow the sign board of ` Tung Choi Street ' -LRB- the actual name of ladies st. -RRB- and you can reach there -LRB- preferable in the night -RRB- . Do n't forget to bargain as usual tourists are always on the chopping block . Do not think you can speak Cantonese well as once you speak , from the slang they will know you are not locals . Bear in mind ENTITY_Hongkongers are one of the smartest people in the world . All in , if you bring around $ 3,000 / - for 4 nights should be enough .

If your budget is low , then bring about S$ 50-100 per day per person should be enough for if you have accommodation . This is enough for few trips on MTR and/or bus ride , 2 simple meals at hong kong style cafe and some cheap museum trip and without night entertainment . If you do not want those , then you have to rise your budget .

There is NO limit of how much you can spend OR want to spend . Go to ENTITY_Nathan_St. and you find them sellig real Rolex like in the Grocery shop . Gold items like they are going out of fashion . AWESOME ! If you are a man and going , do n't take you wife there . If your wife is going , give her a plastic surgery . -LRB- cut her credit card -RRB- Whooaaahahahah ! But it is a very nice place to go , The food , the seafood .
