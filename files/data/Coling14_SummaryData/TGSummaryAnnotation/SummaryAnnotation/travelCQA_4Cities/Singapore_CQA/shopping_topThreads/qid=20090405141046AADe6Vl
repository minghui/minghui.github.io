Generally ENTITY_Singapore shopping complexes and stores along ENTITY_Orchard_Road offer a wider variety of choices , newer products than the rest of ENTITY_South_East_Asia - prices are about the same when compared to local currencies . Oh yes , you can be very sure all products sold in ENTITY_Singapore are originals unlike in some neighbouring countries where the origin of make is doubtful .

But if you 're from , say , ENTITY_Indonesia or ENTITY_Thailand , you may find the prices here much higher . Again , it depends on what you want to buy . Boutique names are pretty easy to find here . Also electronics and clothing -LRB- if you 're `` asian-sized '' e.g. size 14 EUR and below , otherwise it 's a little difficult -RRB- . For something to take home as souvenir / gifts , I would suggest getting something local . The stuff you can find in museum shops or bigger department stores like Tangs or ENTITY_Takashimaya . At least their souvenirs do n't look cheap and tacky like those sold in touristy places like ENTITY_Chinatown . .

S'pore is a shopping & food paradise in the Asian market , but not really cheap as compare to some . It is worth doing the shopping because of most duty free products and world latest electronic goods and updated fashion . Less imitation & violation of copy right items .

I think it is a little more reasonably priced than ENTITY_Europe , and pretty similar to the ENTITY_US , but certainly not as cheap as other parts of ENTITY_Asia . Also depends on what you 're shopping for .

You can find some deals at more local shopping centres -LRB- away from town center -RRB- . Bugis area has an outdoor market where you can find some cheap clothes and accessories . If you want cheap , go to ENTITY_Vietnam !
