Sorry ca n't remember name and exact address . But it sells winter jackets , sweaters , track pants real cheap . I got a really good jacket for only $ 10 and a thick bathrobe for only $ 8 there . 2 . Another good place are the various Export Shops -LRB- eg ENTITY_Holland_Village , Tanglin Mall -RRB- . But you do have to just try your luck as not always got good items there . 3 . Sometimes I also see the winter clothes adverts in the newspapers , ENTITY_Straits_Times . They appear regularly . These are the winter clothes warehouses . 4 . There is also a good winter clothes shop in ENTITY_United_Square .
