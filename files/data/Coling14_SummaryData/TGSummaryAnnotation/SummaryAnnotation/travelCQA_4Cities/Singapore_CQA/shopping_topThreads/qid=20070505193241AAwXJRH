As for curler , unless its meant for travelling or has a switch to change from 110V to 240V , then u can use that . In ENTITY_Singapore we use AC240 . ENTITY_Singapore uses ENTITY_UK standard 3 pin plug . Anyway , you can always borrow it from the hotel , I always do that . Enjoy shopping

You will only need the appropriate plug -LRB- adapter -RRB- to use it in ENTITY_Singapore . Just to double check Look for the voltage necessary for the laptop -LRB- it will be on the rectangular block of the power supply cord -RRB- . You should see something like 100-240V . This means you can use any power source that has voltage in that range . And for Curling iron get the adapter with 1600 Watts . Note that 50 watts converter is no good for Curling iron . I brought one today from ENTITY_Ebay for $ 16.00 . In store its more costly . following is the one I brought . It comes with plugs too .

It will tell you on the package it can be used everywhere in the world . I would leave the curling irons at home and buy local . Small electrical items are very cheap . Have a good trip . Cheers
