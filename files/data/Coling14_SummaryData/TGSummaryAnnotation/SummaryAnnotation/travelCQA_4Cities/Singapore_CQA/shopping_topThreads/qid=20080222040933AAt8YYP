But you should try Lucky Plaza in ENTITY_Orchard road . They have a lot of shops selling branded watches like Rolex . And it might be cheaper there cos my sister bought that sort of watch before over at some shop in Lucky Plaza Actually , ENTITY_Rolex has its own building just along ENTITY_Orchard_Road , very near to Lucky Plaza . Not too sure whether you can actually buy their watches there . But if you could , i 'm sure they probably have every model . Just in case you ca n't find yours at those retail shops .

I dun really recommend Lucky Plaza for some of the shops are known for selling imitation things . . i wont commend that place but it is more secure to buy @ the above 2 places . .
