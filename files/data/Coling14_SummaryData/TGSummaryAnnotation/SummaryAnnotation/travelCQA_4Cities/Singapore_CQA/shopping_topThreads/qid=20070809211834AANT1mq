Look around any mall and you can find one winter clothing shop . If not , along ENTITY_MacPherson_Road close to ENTITY_Paya_Lebar_Road is a building with warehouse sale on winter clothes , also in ENTITY_Kaki_Bukit_Crescent , there is a warehouse selling winter clothes too . Not difficult to get these stuff here now . Most are local or regionally made for the western markets anyway .

Else , maybe Forum might be another place to check out since there are so many children 's wear there . plus if you are looking for winter wear , i believe stock will mostly be carried by ang moh , international brands and not the local shops .
