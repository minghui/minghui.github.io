If you do like Indian style clothes then ENTITY_Serangoon_Road , heading from Mustafas into the city is great for shopping -LRB- but always busy -RRB- Tip for ENTITY_Mustafas , it 's 24 hour , so if you can get there earlyish then it is worth it -LRB- especially at weekends - do n't go there after about 10am on weekends as it gets packed -RRB- . Bugis market is good -LRB- opposite Bugis village mall -RRB- but it also gets very busy . If you walk through Bugis Market , the Albert St area -LRB- pedestrianised -RRB- has lots of market stalls and there 's a big ENTITY_OG department store there too which is worth checking out .

You can get good cheap clothes if you browse through malls at ENTITY_Orchard_Road . . ENTITY_Takashimaya , ENTITY_Plaza_Singapura , ENTITY_Robinsons , ENTITY_Centerpoint , ENTITY_Orchard_Plaza , etc. . are some of the malls in ENTITY_Orchard_Road for you to get good and cheap clothes . ENTITY_Great_Singapore_Sale havent yet started , so guess you better wait until they launch ENTITY_GSS , then you come here lah . . For hair products try to fix an appointment with ENTITY_Mr._David_Gan at Passion Hair Salon @ ENTITY_Orchard_Road . . He is the best when it comes to Hair in ENTITY_Singapore . . He might recommend you the best and suitable hair products for your hair type and any treatments if necessary , you can get it done in his shop itself . No need address info when roaming around in ENTITY_Singapore , because its a really tiny country .

Then , after seeing the latest trends etc. . I would suggest that you head over to ENTITY_Far_East_Plaza or Bugis to make your purchases ! :D They offer a wide range of clothes , from street style to work . I really love going to far east , it was and will always be a pleasure . For bugis street , its more for teens and mis twenties . The only con is that some shirts are really quite not worth the price , as the material is quite thin . Have fun though !
