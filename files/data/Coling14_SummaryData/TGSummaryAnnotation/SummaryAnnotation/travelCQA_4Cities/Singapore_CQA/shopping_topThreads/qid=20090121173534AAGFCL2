Most restaurants will be closed too . Is this true ? For me , this sounds strange becasue in ENTITY_Shanghai , ENTITY_CNY is maybe the most important time to boost comsumption . Thanks .

The period leading up to ENTITY_CNY is the most important time to boost consumption . They will go shopping before CNY to prepare for ENTITY_CNY . However , on CNY day itself , most people are busy visiting each other and doing their traditional stuff . No time to go shopping in shopping centres . By the way , I have no idea if the isetan close on that day because I do not go shopping on the first day of the New Year . Even if you look at ENTITY_USA , the period leading up to Thanksgiving and Christmas are the busiest days and so is the day after holidays . you never hear of any sale on the actual day itself . By the way , as I understand ENTITY_China , before CNY , most of the migrant worker population already left the cities to go back to their hometown . So is is impossible that CNY day is the most important time to boost consumption when the a lot of the population is not there ! Are you sure you are from ENTITY_Shanghai ? EDIT : ENTITY_Sarah , I did not say the stores are closed . I said the main sales period is before and after the holidays . We hear of Christmas sales -LRB- which starts before Christmas -RRB- and Boxing day or Black Friday sales . The bulk of the sales done is never on the actual day itself . The person asking the question implied that on the actual day , the stores should be the most crowded which is not the case .

I used to be the case . But since about 5 years ago , more and more stores are keeping their doors open to compete for the business , for those shoppers who are not so organized as to do all their shopping before the holiday . There will always be some who just have to go out and buy something that they can not live without on the particular day . Maybe they are lonely people who have no families . Whatever the reason , the stores have done enough market research to determine that there is enough business to warrant the expense of having the stores open . Once one store stays open , the next years , several more followed . By now , a large of them are open all year round . To answer the original question , I think it should be a decision of the particular store itself . In general , I find ENTITY_Singapore store owners are weary of long hours of operation . Many in the malls are not open until 11 in the morning , which to me , is way too late , and makes one feel that they are very lazy .
