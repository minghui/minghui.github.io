ENTITY_Far_East_Plaza has A LOT of young , trendy , fashionable stuff . And while you 're at ENTITY_Far_East_Plaza -LRB- which is in the Orchard Road area -RRB- , do check out the surrounding shopping malls too ! It 's a shopping heaven there . As per previous answerer 's answer , the recently opened ENTITY_Vivocity is also a good place to shop . Personally , I think it is quite an expensive place . -LRB- It houses brands , you see ... -RRB- I highly recommend Bugis Junction and Bugis Street for its wide range of trendy & affordable stuff . Bugis Street is a really busy street with a lot of great finds . Do pick up a copy of the ENTITY_Singapore Tourist Guide from the airport upon your arrival . Hope you 'll enjoy your stay in ENTITY_Singapore and have a great time shopping ! = -RRB-
