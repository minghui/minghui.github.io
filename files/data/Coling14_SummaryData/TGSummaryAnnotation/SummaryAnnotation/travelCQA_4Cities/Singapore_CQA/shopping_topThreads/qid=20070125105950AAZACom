You can go directly to Bras Basah Complex , it is a well-known place in ENTITY_Singapore , also greatly known as `` City of Books '' . Inside this building , there are so many bookstores which are selling 1st and 2nd hand reference books , the prices are relatively cheaper than other bookstores outside of this complex . Alternatively , you can visit Knowledge bookstore or Popular bookshop , located in the complex for a wide selection of computer books . Walk around the few levels and you can ask around the bookstore assistants on which brand or what type of books you 're looking for . Also , ask for a better price or discounts when you buy more . Lastly , you can try MPH bookstores but they 're not inside Bras Basah Complex . 1 of the MPH branches are in ENTITY_Robinson_Rd and the other shop is very near Bras Basah Complex , at MPH house . Visit http://www.yellowpages.com.sg for more details and http://www.streetdirectory.com and http://www.smrt.com.sg for road guides and directions to get to Bras Basah Complex .
