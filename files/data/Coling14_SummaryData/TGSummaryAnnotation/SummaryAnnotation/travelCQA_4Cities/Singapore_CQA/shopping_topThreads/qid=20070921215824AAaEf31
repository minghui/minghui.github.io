Basically people with things to sell will go there and set up a stall . I believe the ENTITY_Heeren also organises a flea market once a month .

Salvation army has a wide range of stuff from toys to clothings to furniture . However , there are no branches near orchard road . the nearest one is at the following Address : Praisehaven 500 ENTITY_Upper_Bt_Timah_Road S -LRB- 678106 -RRB- Telephone : 6349 5312 Fax : 6766 9703 Operating hours : 10.00 am - 6.00 pm , Mon â€ Thu 10.00 am - 9.00 pm , Fri â€ Sat I have attached the link for other various branches below . But if you are looking purely for 2nd hand clothings , you can go to the flea market at tangling mall every 1st and 3rd sat of the month i think . Starts at around 3pm to 11pm . If you are looking for 2nd hand toys and collectibles , then china square central would be a good place . It 's open every sunday from 11am to 6pm .
