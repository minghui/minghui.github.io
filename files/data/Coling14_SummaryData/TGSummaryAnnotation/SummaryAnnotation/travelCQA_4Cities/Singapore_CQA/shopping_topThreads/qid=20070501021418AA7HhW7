You can get them at a reasonable price . And if you 're buying more , you may even fetch for a better price after bargaining . Most shops in the building are buying and selling new or old books , so you can just go in to the stores and browse for the books you 're searching for and if you ca n't find , just ask the store keepers for assistance . I 'm sure you 'll regret going there for buying your reference books . This is the BEST place in ENTITY_Singapore where you can get cheap and great books !!!!

It 's right in front of the escalator . -LRB- Either on 2nd or 3rd floor -RRB- . If it 's still new or in good condition , I do n't suppose you will be able to get it very cheap though . I 'd suggest you just get them from the library . I do n't find such books worth a second reading . Good luck .
