I have booked flights to take my mum & dad to ENTITY_Singapore , but yet to find a good but cheapish hotel . Last time I went I stayed at ENTITY_Victoria hotel -LRB- mid price -RRB- but need somthing a little better for my folks ! Any ideas please ?

But you may want to raise your budget a little bit if you want something better , as you should know every cent counts for quality here . Here are some of the choices : 1 -RRB- ENTITY_Allson hotel - next to Victoria Hotel 2 -RRB- Hotel on the ENTITY_Queens - behind ENTITY_Allson Hotel.walk through ENTITY_Allson to get there . 3 -RRB- Strand Hotel - on Bencoolen if I 'm not wrong . 4 -RRB- York Hotel - at ENTITY_Orchard_Road . Walk through ENTITY_Goodwood_Park_Hotel to get there . 5 -RRB- ENTITY_Elizabeth_Hotel - Probably slightly a bit more than ENTITY_Victoria and in ENTITY_Orchard . But you 've got to walk up a slope to get there . 6 -RRB- ENTITY_Furama_Hotel_City_Centre - at ENTITY_Chinatown . near ENTITY_Chinatown mrt station . 7 -RRB- Mirama Hotel - quite out of the way , but walking distance from mohd sultan . 8 -RRB- ENTITY_Furama_Hotel_Riverfront - f.k.a. Novotel Apollo Hotel . next to ENTITY_Mirama . 9 -RRB- Holiday Inn Atrium - f.k.a. Concorde Hotel or Glass Hotel . a little farther down from 7 & 8 . walking distance from ENTITY_Zion_Road food market . 10 -RRB- ENTITY_Bayview_Hotel - a boutique hotel on Bencoolen.opposite of Strand Hotel . Notice why I did n't suggest Hotel 81 or Frangrance Hotel ? Because I do n't think they are appropriate to house your parents in a love hotel and watch old men bringing in ENTITY_China ladies in and out each time they pass by the lobby .

Walking distance to ENTITY_Orchard_Road and the ambience is good . If your parents are coming in mid early - mid September , better book a hotel fast as there is a vry large convention in the city and most of the hotel rooms will be booked .

If it 's anything over two weeks , why not consider thresorts at pasir ris . Believe you can get a better deal on long-term lease . Only drawback is the distance to town ENTITY_Orchard_Parade hotel or even hotel royal -LRB- near newton -RRB- are okay too . Hotel 81 at chinatown is n't that bad actually especially if they want to have a look around the area

Any Hotel in ENTITY_Geylang , ENTITY_Chinatown and CBD area will be fine . I do stay near the hotel distict of ENTITY_Singapore , where there are lots of hotels nearby . Hotel Bencoolen which is located at ENTITY_Bencoolen_Street is a good bet and ENTITY_Albert_Court_Hotel is located near the ENTITY_Little_India_Area is another good one . If you want to know more cheap hotel , you can contact me .

Try the New Seven Storey Hotel at Bugis instead . It 's at a convenient location and a short walk away from ENTITY_Seiyu , a mall . And it 's a 5 minute walk from the nearest ENTITY_LRT station . Other good choices would be ENTITY_YMCA and ENTITY_South_China_Sea_Hotel ; although it 's situated next to a temple - could get rather busy & noisy in that area not to mention the inconvenience .

It 's quite clean and relatively cheaper than the hotel chains . If it 's a short stay , you can try getting the boutique hotels like Hotel 1929 , New Majestic Hotel or Scarlet . These are above $ 150 per nite , but their decor is fantastic . If you do n't want to pay the price just for the decor , you may consider the hotel chains . M Hotel at ENTITY_Anson_Road has very spacious rooms , very easy to move around from there . ENTITY_Pan_Pacific and Oriental have finished their reno earlier , and their rates are comparable to M Hotel as well . M may be a cheaper choice as it is really very into business travellers .
