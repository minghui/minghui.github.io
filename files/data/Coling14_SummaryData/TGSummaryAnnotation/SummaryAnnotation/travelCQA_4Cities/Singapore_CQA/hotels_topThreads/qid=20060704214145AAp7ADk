These hotels are all a great value and I think they all serve a continental breakfast . You also earn points with each night 's stay and can accumulate points for free nights .

I can safely say that Golden Landmark will be closer to the ENTITY_MRT and shopping places than the other 2 . It is just across Bugis Junction Shopping centre where the ENTITY_MRT station is too . Other budget hotels in the vicinity will be Bencoolen Hotel and Hotel 81 . You can check out www.hotel81.com.sg and www.hotelbencoolen.com . Or even ENTITY_YMCA , www.ymca-hotels.com/singapore/ymca/
