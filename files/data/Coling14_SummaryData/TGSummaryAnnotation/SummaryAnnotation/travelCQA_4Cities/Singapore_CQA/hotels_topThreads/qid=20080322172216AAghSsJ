Also , i 'm not sure of your meaning of expensive , so here are just some suggestions : I will try not to suggest those apparent hotels which are in Orchard Rd , because i think you can find them easily for yourself right ? Like ENTITY_Hilton , Grand Hyatt , St Regis..Shangri-La ... etc. . it 's a given . If you want great service , you may want to try ENTITY_Conrad_Centennial_Singapore , they 've earned many service awards . Located near Millenia Shopping Centre , ENTITY_Marina_Square and ENTITY_Suntec_City_Shopping_Centre . Website : http://conradhotels1.hilton.com/en/ch/hoâ€?Hotel ENTITY_Intercontinental_Singapore : This is one of my fav hotels because the architecture is a little oriental . It is located at Bugis area . It 's not in the Orchard rd shopping heart of ENTITY_singapore , you 'll need to take a cab or mrt there , but ENTITY_singapore is small , and it 's easy to get around . http://www.singapore.intercontinental.coâ€?New Majestic Hotel : This is one of a kind , old and modern mix small boutique hotel , it 's in ENTITY_Chinatown . Short distance away are sights and sounds of ENTITY_Chinatown ... -LRB- if you 're more adventurous sort -RRB- . Website : http://www.newmajestichotel.com/ ENTITY_Swissotel , The ENTITY_Stamford : Located at ENTITY_Raffles_City area . right next to raffles city shopping centre and a walk away from our grand dame , Raffles Hotel . http://www.swissotel.com/swissotel.com/Eâ€?Scarlett Hotel : Here 's another very nice small boutique hotel , it 's something different . I think you may like this . Near ENTITY_Chinatown . http://www.thescarlethotel.com/ For more options , visit this site and look under ` Where to stay ' http://www.visitsingapore.com Enjoy your trip !

Remember to book in advance so that you can get a lower room rates . : -RRB-
