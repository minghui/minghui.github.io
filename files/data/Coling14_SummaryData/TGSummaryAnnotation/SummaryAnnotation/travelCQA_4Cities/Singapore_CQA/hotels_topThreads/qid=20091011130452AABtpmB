Some public housing owners may rent out room for about > $ 300 for a week but to have 7 of you cramped into a room may be way too much for a room . Given your budget , it 'll still be more practical to look at hostels/backpackers dorms instead .

I am not aware of any hotels that allow 7 guests to cramp up in one room . ENTITY_YMCA will be a good place to stay and safe too . Safety is in numbers and there are 7 of you all cramped up in the dorm , if I am up to no good , I will run for my safety and not the other way round . ENTITY_LOL .

Trying a budget hotel or hostel would make a lot more sense . Sometimes the rooms are right next to each other and you can rent out an entire wing of the building . Then you could all be across the hall from each other !
