Not if you 're staying in ENTITY_Singapore . The one on the link provided by `` Tiger '' above is probably the same one . When I stayed quite a few years ago , it was terrific . It still looks terrific but obviously done up again since I was there -LSB- unless there are 2 of them -RSB- . The ensuites were spotless , had a bath , shower and toilet , hairdryer , the lot . The tv was big screen . The beds were BIG and very comfy . You get the first 6 hours for the price , then you pay by the hour for extra .

About 300 metres away at Lorong 22 ENTITY_Geylang , there are a few Budget Hotels along the road . Try the Compass Hotel . Despite being in the red light area , there are lots of ethnic foods and eatery opens till late , some until 4 am . Taxi fares in ENTITY_Singapore are not expensive so no real need to stay close to the airport .
