Transportation is really convenient from these locations to most attractions in ENTITY_Singapore , including by foot . ___ Marina-Raffles Area ___ These hotels are connected to the City Hall subway , via City Link underground shopping mall -LRB- http://www.citylinkmall.com -RRB- : - ENTITY_Swissotel_Stamford -LRB- directly above station -RRB- - Pan ENTITY_Pacific - ENTITY_Ritz_Carlton - Marina Mandarin - ENTITY_Conrad -LRB- got ta walk a little to ENTITY_Suntec_City -RRB- ___ Orchard Area ___ Lots of hotels in this area , given that this is the shopping hub , but the following are nearer to the ENTITY_Orchard_Station - ENTITY_Marriot - Hyatt If you do n't mind a little walk to the station -LRB- 5 to 10 min -RRB- , other hotels include : - Four Seasons - ENTITY_Regent - Mandarin ENTITY_Singapore - ENTITY_Goodwood Park Hotel Regarding the airport , ENTITY_Singapore is really small so anywhere would be convenient for transportation by cab . It would just be 20-30 minutes to reach the airport , fare around S$ 20 . Unless you wish to take the ENTITY_MRT -LRB- subway -RRB- to the airport , then I 'll suggest that you stay in hotels with underground connection to the ENTITY_MRT stations , such as the ENTITY_Swissotel_Stamford -LRB- http://singapore-stamford.swissotel.com/бн which is connected to City Hall station . also a major inter-change station . All the hotels listed above are 4 or 5 star ones , so the standard is about the same between them . Personally , I 've stayed at only some of them , so I ca n't judge all but I 'll recommend the Marriot or ENTITY_Swissotel_Stamford . Enjoy your stay !
