It 's very cheap , $ 20 per night . It 's in the ENTITY_East and near to the Airport . On the downside , strangers will ask you `` How much ? '' as it is a seedy neighbourhood . On the upside , you are centrally located and also near to lots of good food .

Also , try to avoid ENTITY_Geylang if you are a girl , coz afterall its a local red light district
