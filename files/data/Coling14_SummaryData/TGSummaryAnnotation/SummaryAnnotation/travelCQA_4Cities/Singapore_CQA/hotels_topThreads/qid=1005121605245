All the big name such as ENTITY_Hyatt , Mandarin etc. are there . Make sure you stay within walking distance to Orchard rd. . That 's where all the shopping malls are . I 've stayed at many hotel but I like ENTITY_Orchard hotel . It 's at one end of Orchard rd. so you can just walk to all the malls -LRB- and there are lots and lots of malls -RRB- . If you want a posh hotel with a colonial feel , try the Raffles hotel . When you get tired of shopping , go to the see the orchards at Orchard park and then go to the night zoo . ENTITY_Singapore airlines has a tour bus that you pay once and can get on and off at all the malls and tourist site . Have fun !

It is newly refurbished , 4star price with 5star everything else . Near to subway , shopping centre , gadget mall , great food and awesome arts centre . Do n't confuse this hotel with The ENTITY_Plaza_Parkroyal . Almost same name but the Grand Plaza is near City Hall ENTITY_MRT . If money is no object , go ahead with ENTITY_Ritz_Carlton_Millenia ... The bathtub is situated beside a big window overlooking the marina will justify the price :oD If you want dirt cheap , try Hotel 81 chain ... most of it located near sleazy place ... but some are in cultural area .

It is located within walking distance to major sites and I think is one train/tram ride away from the shopping district -LRB- name escapes me now -RRB- .
