Another option is to stay at hotels around the city . For cheaper hotel with good quality , look for hotels along bencoolen road , such as strand hotel , bencoolen hotel , or city ENTITY_bayview . Those hotels are family kind of hotel , and they located relatively close to everywhere . Dont get any hotels around mount elizabeth area , unless you want to push you baby pram up the hill . These hotel is located on top of the hill -LRB- York hotel , ENTITY_Elizabeth_Hotel , etc. -RRB- The hotels that located along ENTITY_Orchard road are all good hotels . Problem is , their room rates start from $ 150 and above . Those hotels I mentioned earlier are in a good decent budget from $ 60 - $ 80 per night for a comfortable standard twin room .
