Once the first three people checked in , the three people should go inside the room . Send one person from the room to go outside and tell the other three people the room number and which floor it is on . Once that person has told the three people outside of the hotel the information of the room , s/he should go up back to the hotel and wait with the other people in the room . The three people outside of the hotel should then go up to the room . There that 's how you get six people inside of a room . The two groups should also go in separately whenever you guys go back to the hotel . For an example , one group should go first , then the other group goes in after about like 4-5 minutes to make it less suspicious .

I can relate to your dilemma but do understand that Hotels in ENTITY_Singapore are really constrained by size . If you 're on a budget , you may want to avoid Hotels in the heart of the ENTITY_Orchard area . Though it 's very convenient for shopping , the costs are pretty high . Move slightly away from the Orchard area . Try places like around ENTITY_Clarke_Quay . Log on to ENTITY_Singapore Hotel Discount and it will take you in to the locations where you can find the hotels that best suits your needs . -LRB- I just ENTITY_Google it for you . -RRB- -----
