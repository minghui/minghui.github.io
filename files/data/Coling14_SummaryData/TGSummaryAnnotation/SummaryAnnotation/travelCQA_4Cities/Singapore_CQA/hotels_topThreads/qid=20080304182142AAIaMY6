Can also consider ENTITY_Holiday_Inn at ENTITY_Outram area . Can also try your luck at this Park Hotel -LRB- formerly known as Crown Prince Hotel -RRB- which is located in ENTITY_Orchard_Road . They offer quite a good corporate but not sure about normal rate .

You should also book in advance . Even hotels on the outskirts of town like ENTITY_Copthorne_Waterfront , ENTITY_Holiday_Inn_Atrium etc are quite fully booked most of the time . And booking in advance will also get you a lower rate .

They 've got a computerized system set up there where you can choose what kind of bed you want -LRB- single/king/whatever -RRB- , area you want , within your budget , etc. . Then it spits up a whole list for you to choose from . The listings are complete with pictures . You choose there , they book it there and you are off to your hotel within minutes . Check in when you get there is painless and fast , even if you 're arriving in the middle of the night because they notify the hotel before you even arrive on their doorstep . Honest to god , I use it every time because it 's easy , affordable and fast and I do n't have to worry about getting burned by the travel agents who claim that they are giving you a good rate on hotel vouchers . I have found decent hotels for 50 % off their walk in rate by using this service . For far less than $ 150 a night . Pretty sweet .
