I 'm going to be heading over to ENTITY_Singapore for a few days in November and I was wondering if anyone could recommend a nice hotel in ENTITY_Singapore ? I would prefer something fairly central and preferably 4 stars and above . I have had a look at some accommodation brochures and the ENTITY_Royal_Plaza on Scotts looks pretty good but I 'd like some other suggestions before I make any commitments .

They have windows , but facing the carparks -LRB- and its not even an open carpark , its an internal carpark -RRB- Try checking Rendezvous , its near ENTITY_Orchard_Road too There is a nice , new , chic hotel ... very classy . . its called ENTITY_Naumi_Hotel , it has a floor for ladies only . It is located at ENTITY_City_Hall , its also a shopping haven with plenty more to offer than ENTITY_Orchard_Road -LRB- which is mainly shopping -RRB- City Hall is close to Bugis too with loads of attractions , and cultural sites . All in all , ENTITY_City_Hall is the best place to be , its very central and if you want to go anywhere , the subway is just 5minutes away .

You can try staying @ ENTITY_Marriott_Singapore , ENTITY_Hyatt , ENTITY_Meritus_Mandarin , Park Hotel - ENTITY_Orchard . . All these Hotels are located in ENTITY_Orchard_Road itself & about the price range of ENTITY_Royal_Plaza on ENTITY_Scotts . . Personally I have stayed at Royal Plaza , Do find the room very well done & service is good . . But agree , the view from some of the rooms is lacking . . If you wished to stay in other areas , try Gallery , ENTITY_Swissotel_Standford , ENTITY_Merchants_Court , ENTITY_Amara , Rendezvous , New Majestic , ENTITY_Conrad . .
