The hotel I stayed before is called Crown Prince Hotel , right at downtown ENTITY_Singapore . There are many hotels there , depends on your budget . Try http://www.asiatravel.com/ to check for hotels in ENTITY_Singapore . The site will give you a better rate than expedia , travelocity and ENTITY_orbitz . ENTITY_Robertson_Quay , is also nice , but not in downtown , but then ENTITY_Singapore is quite small , so Taxi is not that expensive . The Crown Prince Hotel is not listed in asiatravel.com , you might want to email them , to see if they can give you a good rate , most of the time they can . I did it last year with asia travel . The ENTITY_Elizabeth is also a nice hotel , but more expensive than Crown Prince . Good Luck
