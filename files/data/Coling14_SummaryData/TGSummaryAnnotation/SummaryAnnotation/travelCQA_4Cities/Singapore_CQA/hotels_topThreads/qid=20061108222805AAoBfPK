Dining in the area is expensive unless you are willing to foot the bills , try to dine in ENTITY_HDB neighbourhoods instead , Sometimes they offer quality food at very low prices . As I say orchard room is a shopping paradise , but it seems every neighbourhood in ENTITY_singapore have at least one shopping centre , you can choose other hotels out of the city if you do n't mind travelling , ENTITY_Singapore is small anyway . Room ? I do n't know but should be quite good , because of its location . Transportation ? What mode ? Travel by taxi from the airport to this hotel takes 15-30 minutes .
