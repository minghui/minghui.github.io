You are better off in a backpacker Hostel which charge around s $ 50 per night for a room or from s $ 15 per night for a bunk bed . You can email me if you want some more details

Since what you think to be affordable is subjective , I 'd suggest that you do a hotel search . Type in the price that intend to pay , and you will have a list of hotels to choose from . One of such engines can be found on the reference site below .

It is simple but clean , and although there is some ` red light ' activity it has never bothered me ; the hotel keeps the ` short time ' business and the tourists on separate floors . I think they have triple rooms . 7 minutes walk from ENTITY_Kallang_MRT . Book it through agoda.com which seems to do the best rates . I found that hostels are more expensive than hotels once there is more than one person .

In Spore most hotels are safe , clean & are clearly classified in budget range . The 5 stars in Orchard Road/Marina -LRB- $ 250 / - downward -RRB- , 4 stars in ENTITY_Havelock_Road -LRB- Below $ 200 to $ 170 -RRB- , 3 stars in ENTITY_Middle_Road area -LRB- $ 150 - downward -RRB- . Make you choice ... 3 pax in a room , not a problem .
