Hotels often provide a number of additional guest services such as a restaurant , a swimming pool or childcare . Some hotels have conference services and meeting rooms and encourage groups to hold conventions and meetings at their location . Hostels provide accommodation where guests can rent a bed , sometimes a bunk bed , in a dormitory and share a common bathroom , kitchen , and lounge . Rooms can be mixed or single-sex , although private rooms are increasingly common in all types of hostels . All hostels are generally cheaper for both the supplier and the occupant and many hostels employ their long-term residents as desk clerks in exchange for free accommodation . I have never heard of a backpacking hotel . . but it is probably much like a hostel ... cheap and affordable , but you usually have to share some of the spaces with other guests

Mostly for international young travelers , because they are not to keen on just hangibg out in their rooms and are mor into getting out and hitting the streets for touring around . I would say hotels in the ENTITY_US range around 50 bucks per night at the cheap end whereas youth/backpacking hostels range around 10 buckeroos per night . Significantly cheaper , but no luxury items like TV or mini-fridge .

A hostel is where they rent rooms in a dormitory style . They are usually very cheap , under $ 20/night . Often times you might share a room with others and also there is usually a shared bathroom . At some hostels you can request a private room with a private bathroom for a few extra dollars .

A hostel can just provide a dorm bed OR it can give you a room with 2-6 single beds for people traveling together . The bath is usually down the hall . Sometimes guest must provide their own bedding , towels , and make their own beds . A backpacking hotel can be the same a hostel but more hotel services .

A hostel is a place where you can rent a room or even just a bed within a large group room and there 's usually shared restrooms and a shared kitchen . When I stayed in one , each group or person got a small shelf for food and was able to use cookware provided by the hostel for making meals . It 's a very cheap and efficient way to travel if you 're short on funds . A backpacking hotel is a generic term for cheap lodging with few extras . Hostels are a type of backpacking hotel , as are low end inns and motels .
