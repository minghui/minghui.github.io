You can find good offers , reviews and ratings from guests -LRB- a great tool to decide based on other people bad or good experience -RRB- . I 'm using it the last three years and I did n't have any problems . The hotels and the rooms were exactly as I red on site . The maps also gives you an idea where the hotels reside . The reservation process is easy and you do n't need to pay with credit card . Enjoy your travel .
