qid=1006051110717_answer_5	2	qid=1006051110717	2006-05-11 11:05:50	answer	 ENTITY_Hi_Carlton_Hotel is a relatively new hotel . So at least you know it is very clean . It is located within the CBD of ENTITY_Singapore , just a short distance from ENTITY_Orchard_Road which is the shopper street . Most of the malls and shops are along this road . Your hotel is located at the southern end of this road . Near your hotel is ENTITY_Sim_Lim_Square . If you are a techo geek , you can get all kind of electronics and computer stuff there , cheap . End May onward is the ENTITY_Great_Singapore_Sale , so big discount tickets can be expected at all shops all over the island . Your hotel is within walking distance to those places as described by ENTITY_Ava , plus ENTITY_Raffles_Hotel , just across ENTITY_Raffles_City . ENTITY_Chinatown is a short ride away . You can check with the hotel how best to get there . Plenty of food options there now , plus shopping carts in the area , especially at night . Other places not to miss is the ENTITY_Singapore_Zoo , Night Safari and ENTITY_Jurong_Bird_Park . World class status accorded to them . There are other places . Can email me at tongbn@yahoo.co.uk if you need more pointers . My birth place .
