There is some small possibility of a pickpocket or a drunk person accosting you . But I never worried about safety when I lived there . ENTITY_Clark_Quay is much better connected to everywhere else . But Bugis is kind of fun too . You wo n't be disappointed with either . I loved the haji lane area . Good food , fun shops . -LRB- Pretty much all ENTITY_Singapore has to offer ... -RRB- Enjoy !

The problem might be the quality of hotel/hostel you stay in . Dont ' trust their own descriptions and pictures . Always check out traveller 's reviews of the hotel you are planning to book , like on ENTITY_tripadvisor.com . ENTITY_Singapore is very well connected in terms of public trnasport so wherever you choose , you will find it easy to travel to wherever you want .
