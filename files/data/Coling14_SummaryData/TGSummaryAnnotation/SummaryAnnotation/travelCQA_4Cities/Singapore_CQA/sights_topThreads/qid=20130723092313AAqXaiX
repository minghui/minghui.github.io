Basically offices and stores is all you have left . The Downtown Core -LRB- Central Business District ; CBD -RRB- is situated around ENTITY_Marina_Bay , where most of the skyscrapers and views of downtown ENTITY_Singapore can be found . The Merlion , ENTITY_Singapore 's nations symbol , is also here . Nearby is ENTITY_Chinatown , which is a bit small but very developed and retains traditional shop house streets . There are quite a few hawker centres -LRB- outdoor food courts -RRB- in this area . ENTITY_Orchard_Road , which is a few stops away on the subway -LRB- MRT -RRB- has dozens of shopping complexes and malls . It is easy to get lost in them , as many connect with each other underground . You 'll see lots of foreign brands here . For tourist activities , the ENTITY_Singapore_Night_Safari and ENTITY_Singapore_Zoo , and ENTITY_Jurong_Bird_Park are popular with animal enthusiasts , but are about 30 mins away , and are not next to each other . ENTITY_Sentosa_Island , situated just below the Downtown Core , is a tourist destination with gardens , beaches , golf courses , and ENTITY_Universal_Studios_Singapore . It can be reached by cable car or taxi from the mainland . Aside from this , the one requirement in ENTITY_Singapore is to visit a hawker centre . There are dozens strewn throughout the country , and locals will be eager to point you in the direction of the closest one and their favorite dishes . The food is cheap , and dishes from ENTITY_China , ENTITY_India , ENTITY_Middle_East , ENTITY_Malaysia , and the West are all lined next to each other in stalls . Its perhaps ENTITY_Singapore 's most famous attraction .

Try the Flyer too as there are only 2 in the world and one is in ENTITY_Singapore . Visit the Merlion Park and the Esplande to have the city view of ENTITY_Singapore . Try dining by the ENTITY_River at ENTITY_Clarke and Boat Quay . You must also visit the world class zoo and the Night Safari . Visit the 2 panda bears on loan from ENTITY_China .

I liked Vivocity shopping mall in particular . Visit Botanical gardens in the morning , free entry , hang around marina bay sands in the evening . Visit Orchard road . hope on a double decker bus ... will cost a couple of ENTITY_singapore dollars . . absorb city views ...

The most interesting shopping center is there too along bayfront Ave. There is n't much to do in ENTITY_Singapore other than eat/drink/shop . ENTITY_Singapore is lacking in culture and the `` attractions '' are underwhelming .
