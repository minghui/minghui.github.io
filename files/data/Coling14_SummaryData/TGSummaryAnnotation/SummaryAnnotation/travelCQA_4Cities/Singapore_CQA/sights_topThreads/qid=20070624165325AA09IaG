You can take these shots from the ENTITY_Cavenagh_Bridge just beside ENTITY_Fullerton_Hotel . Face the ENTITY_Clarke Quay area you will be able to get a nice photo of the old trading areas next to ENTITY_Singapore_River with the new banks behind as the background . If you can try to access ENTITY_Benjamin_Sheares_Bridge -LRB- I think there 's a pedestrian walk just next to the expressway , but not very sure how to go up , from ENTITY_Marina_Square perhaps ? -RRB- , you will be able to get fantastic photos of the Waterfront business buildings with ENTITY_Fullerton_Hotel and the Esplanade , added the Merlion too . Other great photo op moments in ENTITY_Singapore ... Not sure what `` op '' means , but I think the charm in ENTITY_Singapore does n't just lie in the CBD area where the skyline is , but all around . You can find different feelings when you reach into the heartlands , go into the nature reserves , check out the historical buildings like our Museum -LRB- good for photography ! -RRB- and even the flora and fauna you can see all around you . Hope you have a great time taking photos of my homeland !
