You did n't indicate your interest or if you are travelling alone , with friends or family , cos the choices will be different . Generally , people come here for shopping and food . ENTITY_Orchard road has many shopping centres , Vivocity is one big one and less crowded cos of the size , and you can hop on the train to ENTITY_Sentosa_Island for a day trip where there 's beaches , can cycle and places of interests . For food , you can try the Katong/Geylang areas . For family outing , yes the ENTITY_Singapore_Zoo , Night Safari , ENTITY_Jurong_Birdpark are a must . For a more natural setting , go to ENTITY_Pulau_Ubin for a rustic island life , you can cycle , look at the nature , birds , quarry , or just go for seafood . ENTITY_Sungei_Buloh is good for nature walk where migratory birds will stay here till early march before heading back home . Around the ENTITY_Kranji areas are many farms where you can visit too . I recommend some museums visiting too . You can go to the National Museum , the ENTITY_Peranakan_Museum or the Art Museum . The building themselves are worth visiting .

The largest shopping belt in ENTITY_Singapore with many malls and shops to shop . Shopping malls you should visit include the various shopping mall in ENTITY_Orchard_Road and perhaps Vivocity . Neighbourhood places are where you can find authentic good ENTITY_Singaporean style food in the hawker centers and food courts . Well if you 're coming with family as tourists then i believe the Mandai Zoo , ENTITY_Jurong_Bird_Park , Botanic Gardens , ENTITY_Sentosa_Island etc will be some good choices . Oh do check out ENTITY_Little_India , ENTITY_Chinatown and ENTITY_Kampong_Glam in ENTITY_Singapore to know how about cultures of the people too .
