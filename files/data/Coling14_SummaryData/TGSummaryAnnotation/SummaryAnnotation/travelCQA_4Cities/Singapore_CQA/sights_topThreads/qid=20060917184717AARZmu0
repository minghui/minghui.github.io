B -RRB- Empire State Building was build with reinforce concrete . . like ENTITY_Pentagon ... so less damage . . C -RRB- Old buildings ' designs are based on Sturdiness ... unlike new buildings ' design are based on Appearance . . D -RRB- Twin Towers are taller then Empire State Building ... so more `` dead weight '' ... E -RRB- Empire States Building has less steel ... so less tendency to melt under extreme heat ... Cheers ...

Also , the steel reinforcement/concrete with how the building was constructed was much more stable than the aluminum/lighter metals they use in buildings today . The amount of fuel in the plane and they type of fuel it was , was not enough to burn hot or long enough to melt the superstructure -LRB- unlike when the planes hit the WTC -RRB- .

In it they noted that the Empire State disaster was minor damage in comparison to the WTC twin towers . So it 's wrong to say why the Empire State did not crash the way the twin towers did . They were both separate incidents & damages to both buildings respectively were a huge difference . Overall , 9/11 will go down in history the same it did for ENTITY_Pearl_Harbor ~ ~ > a day of terror , evil & infamy . Bless the families who lost their loved ones in this massive tragedy .
