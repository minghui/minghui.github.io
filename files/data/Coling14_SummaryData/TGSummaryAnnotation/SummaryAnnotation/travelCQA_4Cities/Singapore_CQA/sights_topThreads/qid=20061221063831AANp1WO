The city was good fun for a day but very busy . Lots of bargain electronics to be had if you could be bothered searching for them . the public transport system is very big and clean and efficient , especially compared to the tube in ENTITY_London . Good shopping and very clean streets in general . all in all i enjoyed my time there , but i do n't think i would live there - too big for me !

Its true they are really strict but its far from being a police state . I have been to ENTITY_Singapore several times and love it for what it is . Its a great place for shopping and eating and has a really cool colonial feel .
