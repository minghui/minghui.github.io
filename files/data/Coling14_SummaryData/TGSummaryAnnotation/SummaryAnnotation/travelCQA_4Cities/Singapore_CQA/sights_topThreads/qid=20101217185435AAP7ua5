It is part of the ENTITY_Central_Business_District_Area . ENTITY_Clarke_Quay is another famous hangout place in ENTITY_Singapore . ENTITY_Clarke_Quay is an area long the ENTITY_Singapore_River . There are several pubs and entertainment out there . The scenery there is gorgeous as well . ENTITY_Chinatown has a strong Chinese cultural and heritage influence .

The best is you follow the official map of ENTITY_Singapore which you can find every day at the ENTITY_Singapore_Straits_Times in the property section for sale . There you can find all the suburbs where the almost five million inhabitants of ENTITY_Singapore stay . And when you have time you should pay one or the other constituency a visit - you will see a substantial difference to the touristic ENTITY_Singapore . Enjoy your stay .

Pretend ENTITY_California is a country by itself , with it 's own government . ENTITY_Singapore is like that -LRB- I think ENTITY_Singapore is wayyy smaller than ENTITY_California -RRB- . Then in ENTITY_California itself , you have many many smaller towns right ? So ENTITY_Singapore is divided into similar districts or towns . It can also be divided into ENTITY_north_south_east_west_of_course . And in each of the towns , you have like those famous roads -LRB- orchard road and stuff like that -RRB- , compare that to wall street , it 's the same concept . Oh and ENTITY_Singapore is not small islands . It is one tiny island plus a few even tinier islands -LRB- i.e. sentosa -RRB- As for the list : ENTITY_Orchard road is like a long road near central ENTITY_Singapore -LRB- economical central , not geographical central -RRB- , it has many shopping malls . There 's nothing to it more than shop and hotel . ENTITY_Clarke quay is this `` town '' area also near the central , located next to ENTITY_Singapore river . You get club , pubs , bars there . Night life . ENTITY_Chinatown is also this town area where they have speciality chinese food and goods , so it is sort of shopping and culture thing . They have a heritage museum there too . Bukit timah is a `` town '' area . Not much in the town but bukit timah hill is a hill which you basically go climb . Nature and all that , Sentosa is an island off ENTITY_Singapore . It is under ENTITY_Singapore like how ENTITY_Hawaii is part of the ENTITY_US . And there 's a lot of stuff there for tourists . Nature , shopping , thrill stuff . All there . ENTITY_Little_india is like chinatown only it 's all indian goods and food instead of chinese . ENTITY_Marina bay is like right next to the business district and you get the merlion -LRB- an icon -RRB- and a casino there . There 's also ENTITY_Singapore river . Okay , hope I helped !
