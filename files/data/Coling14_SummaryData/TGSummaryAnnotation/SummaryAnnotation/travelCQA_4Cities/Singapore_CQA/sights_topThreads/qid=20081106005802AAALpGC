Being a WWII history buff , I liked the Battle Box on ENTITY_Kent_Ridge , and ENTITY_Orchard road is a classic for shopping ! ENTITY_Chinatown is a great place as well , as is Merlion park . I do n't live in the country anymore , so I do n't know about the newer things , but last I remember the Esplanade -LRB- ` Durian ' -RRB- was the latest thing . Food , the national pastime , was great mostly everywhere as far as I remember , and the supermalls are good if you like shopping . I 'm sure there 's more , but that 's all I can think of right now ...
