I would recommend the cable car though as you can see many sights . when you wan na come back to the main island then you can take the cable car back again

There are many buses there -LRB- ask the hotel reception -RRB- and the train goes there as well . If you are taking the bus , get down at the stop in front of ENTITY_Harbourfront . If you are taking the train , take the ENTITY_North-East_Line to ENTITY_Harbourfront station . From there , you have to take the bridge to the other side of the road to take a connecting bus to the island . These buses are easy to recognise as they are marked `` Sentosa '' . If you can help it , dont go there during weekends as the buses and island are quite crowded ! There is also a very large mega mall called ENTITY_Vivio_City just before you cross over to Sentosa but prices are expensive there .

To get to ENTITY_Vivo_City , take ENTITY_MRT to ENTITY_Harbourfront_MRT_Station . The Harbourfront is adjacent to ENTITY_Vivo_City_Shopping_Mall . It 's very easy bcoz S'pore has great transportation system . Many choices available . You can get in by bus , cable car , or monorail . . Depend on your cost and of course they offer different experiences . Have a nice holiday ! Do n't forget to watch the dancing fountain in Sentosa for free at night .

The cable car will get you to Sentosa . When you get here you 'll realize you do not need any guided tours . Hotels will provide you with information on travel and the must sees . Ask any local and they 'll be more than willing to give you directions . Also shopping malls and any service staff at restaurants and cafes will be on hand should you need . It 's a really , really small island .
