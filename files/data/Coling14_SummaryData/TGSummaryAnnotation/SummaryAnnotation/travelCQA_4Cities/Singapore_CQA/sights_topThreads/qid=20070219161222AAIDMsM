Actually ENTITY_Singapore is small country , you can enjoy maximize within 1 day only . Take MRT -LRB- subway -RRB- and go out in every inter exchange station like ENTITY_City_Hall , ENTITY_Ochard , Bugis , ENTITY_Raffles , ENTITY_China town , ENTITY_Little_India . Walk around the subway station is enough for you to maximize ENTITY_Singapore -LRB- food , sights , etc -RRB- . If you have more time , flying down to ENTITY_Indonesia , it is much2 better than ENTITY_Singapore . I will rate it 100 times much beautiful , sights , food , etc. . And also much2 cheaper .
