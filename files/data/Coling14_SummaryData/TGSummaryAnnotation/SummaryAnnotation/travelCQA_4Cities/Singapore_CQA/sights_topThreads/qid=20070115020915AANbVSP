The Merlion was first designed as an emblem for the ENTITY_Singapore_Tourist_Promotion_Board -LRB- ENTITY_STPB -RRB- in 1964 -- the lion head with a fish body resting on a crest of waves quickly became ENTITY_Singapore 's icon to the rest of the world . Designed by ENTITY_Mr_Fraser_Brunner , a member of the souvenir committee and a curator of the ENTITY_Van_Kleef_Aquarium , the lion head represents the lion spotted by the Prince ENTITY_Sang_Nila_Utama of the ENTITY_Sri_Vijaya empire re-discovered Singapura in 11 A.D , as recorded in the `` Malay Annals '' . On seeing a strange beast , -LRB- which he later learnt was a lion -RRB- upon his landing he named the island Singapura . The fish tail of the Merlion symbolises the ancient city of ENTITY_Temasek -LRB- meaning `` sea '' in Javanese -RRB- by which ENTITY_Singapore was known before the Prince named it `` Singapura '' -LRB- meaning `` Lion '' -LRB- Singa -RRB- and `` City '' -LRB- ENTITY_Pura -RRB- in ENTITY_Sanskrit language -RRB- , and it represents ENTITY_Singapore 's humble beginnings as a fishing village . Where is Merlion and where is it located ? The Merlion and the Cub were originally located at the mouth of the ENTITY_Singapore_River , across from the ENTITY_Elizabeth_Walk , just 120 metres from their present location . Also called the Merlion Park , the area soon became a popular tourist attraction and took its place among the famous landmarks of great cities of the world . ENTITY_Mr_Lee_Kuan_Yew , the then Prime Minister of ENTITY_Singapore , officiated the installation ceremony of the Merlion on 15 September 1972 . A bronze plaque commemorated the auspicious occasion with the inscription , `` The Merlion has been erected as a symbol to welcome all visitors to ENTITY_Singapore '' . Today , the Merlion attracts more than 1 million visitors a year who make the trip to the Merlion Park to photograph this world famous icon at her new home , at the adjacent to One ENTITY_Fullerton . INTERESTING FACTS : ENTITY_Singapore has also incorporated lions into our country logo as The Lion Head Symbol and The ENTITY_National_Coat_of_Arms -LRB- ENTITY_State_Crest -RRB- . Thus , ENTITY_Singapore is named as ENTITY_The_Lion_City .
