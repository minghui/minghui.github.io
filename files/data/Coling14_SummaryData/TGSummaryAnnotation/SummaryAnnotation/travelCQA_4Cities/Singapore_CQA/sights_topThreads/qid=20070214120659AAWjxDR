I studied for one year and left for aviation job ! Well , Nuclear power plant is the BEST ! Just imagine , the nuclear plant size is as big as a 2-rooms flat in Bukit Hoe Swee , and the nuclear energy can supply the entire ENTITY_Toa_Payoh and ENTITY_Ang_Mo_Kio for 10 years ! Why not ?! Nuclear power plant save lots of cost ! I can tell you , you will be paying just only $ 200 for your house 's electrical bill -LRB- with 30 days air-con running non-stop -RRB- ! No joke ! FYI , 10 years ago , there was a Singaporean Nuclear Scientist graduated with a PhD in ENTITY_Nuclear_Research . Well , at that time Science board -LRB- now known as ENTITY_DSTA -RRB- do not have a job for her and so she went back to ENTITY_US ! This came out in the ENTITY_Straits_Times many years ago !

No. 2 - Do you know that there is currently no method of disposing nuclear wastes except landfills , which brings me back to reason No. 1 . P/s : we ca n't use wind mills either , because we do n't have space or sufficient wind capacity to produce electricity .

Nuclear is none of those . For a million and one reasons . visit the greenpeace website . Nuclear is DIRTY and contributes to climate change .

In any case I think ENTITY_Singapore 's utility needs can be well served with conventional means . Nuclear powered subs maybe .

qid=20070214120659AAWjxDR_answer_11	2	qid=20070214120659AAWjxDR	2007-02-14 22:44:24 +0000	answer	 Unlikely that ENTITY_Singapore would build a nuclear facility on its territory . The total land area for ENTITY_Singapore is 270 square miles with a population density of 16,392 per square mile . Compare this to ENTITY_New_York_City whose land area is 468 square miles with a population density of 26,700 . Imagine a nuclear facility sitting in downtown ENTITY_Brooklyn . The area north , close to the border with ENTITY_Malaysia , has some acreage free , but not large enough for a facility . Building here would present three major obstacles : 1 . there 's a lack of available land free of housing . Thousands of people would be uprooted ; 2 . in case of a nuclear emergency the only reasonable escape route for most people would be to travel north , passed the damaged facility , into ENTITY_Malaysia ; and 3 . the politics in ENTITY_Southeast_Asia is n't conducive at this point . ENTITY_Singapore , despite it size , is considered to have the most sophisticated and powerful defense force in the region . Some countries may view this as a threat and violate the spirit of the ENTITY_SEA nuclear free zone treaty . If it came to a real need to build a nuclear facility because the region lacked a secured source of power , I see ENTITY_Singapore help financing a facility in ENTITY_Malaysia with the support of other ENTITY_Southeast_Asian countries . But this is a stretch .
