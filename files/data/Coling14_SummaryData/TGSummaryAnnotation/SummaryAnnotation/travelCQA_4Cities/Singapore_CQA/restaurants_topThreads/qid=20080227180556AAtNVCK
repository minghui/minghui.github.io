Chilli and Black Pepper Crab -LRB- if you can take chilli of course -RRB- You can try them at the seafood restaurants at ENTITY_East_Coast_Park . The price may be a little steep though . If you 're looking for cheaper crabs , try places like coffeeshops or hawker centres . Some of them serve really great crabs . 2 . ENTITY_Char_Kuay_Tiao 3 . Laksa -LRB- for chilli eaters -RRB- 4 . Frog Leg Porridge The best i 've tried is in ENTITY_Lavender 's hawker centre . 5 . Satay and BBQ stingray Available in the lagoon at ENTITY_East_Coast_Park . There 's just too much good food in ENTITY_Singapore to be listed down , so try as much as possible when you 're here . Have fun !
