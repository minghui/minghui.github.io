Address : 414 ENTITY_Geylang_Road , -LRB- S -RRB- 389392 . Tel : 68423415 Opening hrs : 12pm - 2am Visit www.nosignboardseafood.com for more details . You must really try their ENTITY_Famous_Chilli_Crab and ENTITY_Black_Pepper_Crab ! That 's their signature dishes in the restaurant . It is simply delicious . Oh yeah , try their ENTITY_Cereal_Crab_&_Butter_Prawns as well , it is so yummy too ! But a word of caution , you must be able to withstand hot chilli in the chilli crab and like spicy seafoods . In fact , it is not really spicy . It is up to individual I guess !!! I really hope you 'll like their chilli crabs and maybe you 'll look for more cravings in the near future . You 'll see alot of people queuing up for the tables on Mon - Fri and especially more on Fri , ENTITY_Sat_&_Sun . By the way , remember to call up for reservation before going down , so that you 'll be sure to have a table seat in the restaurant . Many people have told me they really love to eat the chilli crabs and black pepper crabs when I intro them to eat in No Signboard . Do let me know if you really like the food served there . Anyway , there are a few more other subsidaries located at the National Stadium , The Esplanade and at VivoCity -LRB- so-called largest shopping mall in ENTITY_Singapore -RRB- . When you 're free , try to frequent the other outlets as well ! Check out the location at http://www.streetdirectory.com/restauran¡­
