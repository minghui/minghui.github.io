Most of these hotels , especially those located within the ` red light district ' are being utilised by prostitutes for their business . From your budget , at US$ 100 , you can booked a room at `` Quality Hotel '' which is not far from all major attraction . For tourist calss , The Mirama Hotel , Bay View Hotel , Strand Hotel or The Grand Hotel , which might cost a little more . For good buy , you can also try the Summer View Hotel .
