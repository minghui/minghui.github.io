Take a whole chicken -LRB- uncut -RRB- and season it with salt for about half hour -LRB- inside and outside -RRB- . Depending on the size of the chicken , for a start you can start with 1 teaspoon of salt for the inside of the chicken and 1 teaspoon for the outside . Prepare about 1-2 cloves of garlic -LRB- peeled but leave it whole -RRB- for the chicken and another one for the rice . You can prepare more garlic if you like a stronger garlic aroma . Stuff the garlic into the chicken before cooking it . I prefer to steam the chicken rather than boil it . Put the chicken onto a metal stand , placed in a large bowl . This is so that the oil from the chicken can drip into the bowl when it is being steamed . And the chicken has minimal or no contact with the bowl , for even cooking . The bowl goes into the pot fill with water . The water level need not be too high otherwise when it boils , the water will get into the bowl . Cover and boil for 30 â€ 45 mins -LRB- depending on size of chicken -RRB- . Once the chicken is cooked , use the oils from the bowl to cook your rice . Add in the last garlic when cooking the rice . As the rice is cooking , you can start to chop up the chicken .
