Have a nice day ! ************************************** â€ CNY dinners - ENTITY_Kam_Lun_Tai and Tai Tong Wednesday , February 28th , 2007 How many CNY dinners do we have to go thru a year ? Iâ€™m not sure about you , but Iâ€™ve been to almost the whole 15 days -LRB- excluding lunches -RRB- . Do you all notice that all the chinese restaurants offering the dinner sets looks kinda the same ? and the food all sux ? I had dinners in 5 different restaurants under the Tai Tong group , including the one in ENTITY_Tropicana , ENTITY_Jalan_Ampang and Jalan Bukit Bintang . They all serve practically the same food , and all the service sux . And you know what is the great thing ? During one of the dinners , the host is a regular in that particular outlet -LRB- a ENTITY_TT_Platinum member -RRB- . A captain is assigned to attend only to him , standing by his table , serving his needs . The other table got the normal I-am-busy-so-buzz-off face waiter . Lucky me , I only paid for the ENTITY_Kam_Lum_Tai dinner . Service is as usual , practically hopeless . But at least the food is not pre-cooked . We did have to wait between dishes , but when they came , they were all piping hot and they are quite delicious too . I donâ€™t blame the restaurants for hiring part time school kids to work as they are for sure lacked of staff during CNY . But at least make sure the food is right . I have the tendency to calculate how much would the dishes be if I were to order them ala carte . And most of the time , i think it would be cheaper to order them ala carte .
