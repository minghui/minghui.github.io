The food is both cheap and good and you will always see a huge crowd of diners around dinner time . I grew up eating their Chili Crabs . Their specialties include the Fish Maw , Fried Fish ... they are all nice ! Also , the waiters always round off the bill to the nearest dollar so you 'd pay even less !

If you want good ENTITY_Thai food in a nice setting and you have some money to spend , I found the best one is in ENTITY_Raffles_City -LRB- the shopping mall near City Hall MRT -RRB- . It is called ENTITY_Patara and is located on the 3rd floor of ENTITY_Raffles_City_Mall . They have a branch in ENTITY_Tanglin mall as well . Besides good food , the presentation of the dishes is nice and do n't forget to try out their excellent wine selection for the real fine dining ! I would give this a better rating than the one in ENTITY_Amara hotel -LRB- which I have also tried a few times , the service was n't up to standard and the presentation was very plain -RRB- . I have n't tried Lemongrass yet , but they get good reviews too .
