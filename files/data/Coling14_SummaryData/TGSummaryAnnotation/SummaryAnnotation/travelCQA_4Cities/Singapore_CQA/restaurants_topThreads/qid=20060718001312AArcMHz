Just hail a cab , tell the cab driver to drive you to seafood restaurants at ENTITY_East_Coast . The chilli crab , black pepper crab , sambal sotong and lobster are good stuff . If you want the western cooked seafood , ENTITY_Fish_&_Co serves pan-fried seafood . Grilled fish with fries . Young Singaporeans like it . ENTITY_Fish_&_Co at ENTITY_Glass_House is very nice . Take a train to ENTITY_Doby_Ghaut station -LRB- North-east line -RRB- , and look for Park Mall . ENTITY_Erm , but its not the typical Singaporean seafood you are looking for though . If you want variety , go to ENTITY_Newton . They offer a large variety of seafood there . Stingray is a must to order . You can take a train to ENTITY_Newton station , or just hail a cab again .

But I find the one at east coast the best -LRB- in terms of food taste -RRB- . Besides eating near the sea provides nice ambience as well . Getting there is a bit difficult if you do not drive . The easiest is to take a taxi there . Must try - chili crab and pepper crab . For the chili crab remember to ask for the buns -LRB- crispy on the outside , soft on the inside -RRB- .
