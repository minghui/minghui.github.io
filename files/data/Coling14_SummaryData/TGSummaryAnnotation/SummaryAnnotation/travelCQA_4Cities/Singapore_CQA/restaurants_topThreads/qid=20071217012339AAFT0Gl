I have never heard that belongs to ENTITY_Singapore specials . http://www.coffeeclubworld.com/ Now if you are talking about ENTITY_Singapore dessert such as cheng teng , ice kachang or chengdol desert you can visit any dessert stalls in any Kopitiam . I would recommend ENTITY_Lau_Pat_Sat in Raffles Place . Lots of good food .
