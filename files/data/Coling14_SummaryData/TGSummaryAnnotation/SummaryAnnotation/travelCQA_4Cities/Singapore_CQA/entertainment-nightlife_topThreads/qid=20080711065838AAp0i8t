Hotels with EVEN street number in ENTITY_Geylang_Singapore are in the red light district . It 's true that the ladies are harmless , but it does mean that they will be hovering around your hotel hoping to get business . The area however has an incredible range of eateries and fruit stalls . And many Singaporeans come here for the food . For something in the same budget , you may also consider the friendly New 7th ENTITY_Storey_Hotel - http://www.nsshotel.com

Avoid the even number Lorongs -LRB- or ENTITY_Lor . in short , which mean something like sub-streets -RRB- in ENTITY_Geylang_Road , they are all red light districts . I suggest Fragrance Hotel , ENTITY_Balestier . Its just 10 ~ 15min bus ride to the city from the bus-stop cross the road with bus number 124 . ENTITY_Balestier_Road is almost at the centre of ENTITY_Singapore , hence relatively easier for you and family to move around our island . Hope you enjoy your stay in ENTITY_Singapore ... Cheers ...

Location wise is quite good as its near ENTITY_Kallang MRT Station . Bus stop is also nearby to many places in ENTITY_Singapore . But its pretty near to night clubs and its at ENTITY_Geylang area , so have to be careful and if any children in tow , advise to stay out the area completely . But for anything else , its still a safe area for adult and its pretty near to city area .
