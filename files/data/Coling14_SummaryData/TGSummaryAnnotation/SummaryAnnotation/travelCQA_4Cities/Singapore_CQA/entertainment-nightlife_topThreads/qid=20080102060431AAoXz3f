Alternatively , you can check if the sports programme is available live via online . If so , you can just go to any cybercafe and watch it live .

Anyways have a good time in ENTITY_singapore ! and by the way i support the ENTITY_Pats -LRB- i 'm maybe the only one in ENTITY_singapore that watches ENTITY_american football and supports the patriots ! -RRB- Bet you they will win the bowl and be undefeated ! Good luck on your packers !
