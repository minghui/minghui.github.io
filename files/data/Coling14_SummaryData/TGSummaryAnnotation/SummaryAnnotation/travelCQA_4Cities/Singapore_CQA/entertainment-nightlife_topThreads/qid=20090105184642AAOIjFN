Some allow late check out up to 3pm depending on room availability . You will need to check with the hotel . To get the direct phone number of the hotel , just search for it online at www.yellowpages.com.sg . I 'm sure you can find it . Alternative is to check out at noon but leave your bags at the concierge . There should be no charge for this . However , the 6-month old baby makes this a bit more complicated . Perhaps feed the baby in the lobby ? If you need to shower or use of a room before your flight , there are other options e.g. go to the airport and use the facilities there . I recall Plaza premium centre there allows you to use their facilites for a small fee -LRB- S$ 20 ? -RRB- . Another option is to go to an hourly rate hotel -LRB- e.g. Hotel 81 -RRB- to just use their facilities for an hour -LRB- I think it costs $ 20 per hour ? -RRB- , then go back to your hotel pick up your stuff and go to the airport from there .
