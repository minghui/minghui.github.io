If they want your room before 3 pm , they offer you a showering facility with toilet and chairs to relax and a storage facility . Just tell the desk when you book in . Conversely , when you book online , ask for late check out . Cheaper hotels just offer the storage / luggage facility .

If you read the Terms & Conditions , you will find that whatever time you checked in , you are to check out by either noon or 1pm depending on hotel . But if the period is a low period , they may consider your request of a late check out without additional charges . You will have to ask the hotel to see if they can accommodate this request of yours .
