Nothing to complain about , except that rising food prices means less for average families to eat . -RRB- :

Not all schools end lessons early on Fridays . All the schools I 've attended -LRB- primary , secondary and pre-u -RRB- had Wednesday as the ` early day ' instead of Friday . Most of our CCAs were thus scheduled on Wednesday afternoons .
