When trying to book for hotels in ENTITY_Singapore , we are being told 3 is the maximum number of persons that can stay in one room . Can anyone tell us if we can risk booking only one room as our kids are very small ?

I did understand the problem due to most of this internet booking , they would only allow 3 -LRB- max -RRB- in a room . Anyway , 5 and 2 , I believe the hotel wo n't expect them to stay in a room alone . So , may be it 's better to write or contact them thru email . If you face any difficulty , may be you write or call them direct . For myself , I prefer Intercontinental hotel because my son love it very much . -LRB- They are very friendly towards my son , who are 6 yrs old by now -RRB- .

Just go to the reception alone , leave your family at the lounge or somewhere to sit first , then after booking a room you can bring your family up to your room normally -LRB- do n't act suspicious/show unnecessary anxiety -RRB- . You can do this if you do n't mind sharing beds/sleeping on the floor .

So it be considered a triple room . You can tell your travel agent or hotel that the no. 4 passenger is a small kid and will share existing bedding with you and if the room rate that you are paying includes breakfast , you can kindly inform them that for the extra child breakfast , you can pay direct at the hotel when you are dining . But most of the time , you do n't need to pay for it . .2 yrs old is so little , the most they 'll have are cereal or eggs . . Good luck !

There is no limit in how many people the room can contain unless it states or it is in its house rules . But you have 2 young kids with you , it would be better if you stay in a room . They will not check on you in the middle of the night .
