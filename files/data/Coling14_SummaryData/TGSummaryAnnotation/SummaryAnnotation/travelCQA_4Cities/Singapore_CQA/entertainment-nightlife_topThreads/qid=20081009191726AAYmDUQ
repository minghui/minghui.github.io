But as I 'm not , it 's hard for me to say . However , the popular spots would be : 1 -RRB- ENTITY_Clark_Quay - great lighting , funky places to eat , drink and move to the music . Too bad MOS closed down though . 2 -RRB- ENTITY_Robertson_Quay - not much of a dance-spot , but the atmosphere 's really great , especially at ENTITY_Brewerkz . Where you can get some good food and better beer . Great place to chill and eat with friends along the river . 3 -RRB- One ENTITY_Fullerton - It was a nice romantic place to bring your date . Lots of restaurants , sitting by the sea . But now with the `` sea '' being dammed up , and bright lights shining over at the IR construction spots , not exactly very romantic . There are more , but some good websites for more info are : a -RRB- http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs b -RRB- http://www-singapore.com/nightlife/ c -RRB- http://www.e-clubbing.com/ Hope that helps !

We do have music shows in the park , esplanade 's got an area with live performances , and orchard 's always buzzing with street performances . We should have more variety of festivals and parades but held where the public can participate and attend . E.g , `` Love Parade '' from ENTITY_Germany , or a version of ENTITY_Mardi_Gras . . bring some culture into ENTITY_SG !
