All air con areas are are probihited from smokings which includes taxis , hotels and bars . If you really want to smoke in a taxi , inform the taxi driver forehand before lighting up your cigrette . Note : Not all drivers will allow smoking in their taxis and if you are requesting to smoke , be prepare that the driver will turn off the aircon and lower down the window instead . If you really want to smoke , you need to go out of the air con area into the allowed area of the building to smoke . There 's ashtray on top of trashbins available outside the building for you to dump your cigerette butt . For dining , if you want to smoke while eating your dinner - just simply go to the cafe/restuarants with open area and inform the waiter or waitress that you want to sit in smoking area . They will guide you to an area within a yellow box -LRB- smoking permitted area -RRB- . Smoking on the streets is allow but try to smoke in a less crowded places as some people are easily offended if you blow the smoke towards them . Hope the information is useful .

Just be nice about it and say you have an open pack if they ask . I have seen -LRB- actually its my brother -RRB- them tax per stick becuase my brother tried to mouth them off . 2 You use to be able to bring in a carton but not anymore . 3 Smoking in taxi is not allowed 4 Smoking in Bars are not allowed - Some bars have smoking rooms -LRB- more like fishtanks -RRB- that you can have a smoke in . 5 You can not smoke in the following places : and food places -LRB- including open air places -RRB- , when you are in a queue , any air-con places . 6 Most upper class hotels have desinated smoking areas 7 You can smoke on the street as long as you are not in a queue . But be careful about throwing the butts . Throw them in the bins . Littering carries a fine of $ 500 and corrective training where you need to sweep the streets in uniform . Have fun : -RRB-

For people who think that it is ok to bring in one opened packet , it 's not ok anymore . Someone got pulled to one side for just having 6 ciggs in one pack ! So , better not to bring in anything like that . No ciggies . If you really need to smoke , just bum a ciggy off fellow smokers . Can I smoke in taxis ? No , unless you ask the driver and he allows . Otherwise , generally no . Can I smoke in bars ? There will be a designated smoking room just for smoking . Really uncool though to stand in there and just smoke , not to mention the bad ventilation and funky smells . Do most hotels provide a smoking area ? Ask for a smoking room . Can I smoke on the street ? Yes , but not at bus stops . Ciggies are super expensive in ENTITY_Singapore . The government does n't want us to smoke : - -LRB-

You ca n't bring in more that one open pack . Deal is to bring in two/three open packs and say you ca n't finish them . No cartons and the duty free shop will not even sell you coming in . No in taxis , air-con/confined places , government building and hospitals . Most open air areas are ok but please be reminded that you can smoke only in designated -LRB- yellow boxed -RRB- areas in public hakwer centres too !! I am not sure about pubs since I have not been around the last few months ... been puffing away here in ENTITY_Manila now . Good luck
