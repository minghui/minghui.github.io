I have been there before but I only went to the typical tourist spots in the city . This time around , I would want to experience the nightlife in ENTITY_Singapore this time around ! So , I would want to know where are the best places to go at night . My preference would be the clubs , the band places and , of course , the restaurants !

There are corners for chilling out and having drinks . 4 -RRB- My Secret Garden -LRB- @ Sculpture Centre -RRB- : A cosy little place for a romantic dinner or quiet lunch . 5 -RRB- Balcony Bar -LRB- @ The ENTITY_Heeren -RRB- : The setting is very middle east and there is a jacuzzi pool in the middle of the pub for daring customers . Not to be missed . 6 -RRB- Power Station -LRB- @ Sentosa Gateway -RRB- : If you are really into clubs and band places , do not miss this newest recreation centre . There 9 pubs with different themes all under one building and you just have to pay for one place to enjoy the rest of the pubs free . It is one of the most happening places in town . I think the abovementioned places should be sufficient for a week trip : -RRB- Then again , these are just my humble views . Not many tourists will go to these places as some are quite out of the way . For your info , ENTITY_Singapore will have its own Casino -LRB- Integrated resort : IR -RRB- in a few years time . Hope you have an enjoyable stay in ENTITY_Singapore : -RRB-

It 's the traditional red-light district but the place is much more and bustles at night with clubs , bars , etc etc. .

It is near the ENTITY_Singapore river and there houses great seafood restaurant to clubs , pubs and bars . My fav are ENTITY_Ministry_of_Sound and ENTITY_Zouk -LRB- not very far away from ENTITY_Clarke Quay -RRB- . Clubbing rocks !
