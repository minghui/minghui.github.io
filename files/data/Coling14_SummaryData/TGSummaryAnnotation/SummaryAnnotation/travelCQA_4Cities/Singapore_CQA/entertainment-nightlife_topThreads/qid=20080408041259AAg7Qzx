Heck , this is ENTITY_Singapore . it 's safe . ENTITY_Noone will offer you any drugs ! ENTITY_LOL . Also all the locals go there for some select stores of famous food . Like for example , go to the Dim Sum Store at Sims Avenue near to ENTITY_Geylang Lorong 17 . It 's called ' 126 ' -LRB- name of the restaurant is called 126 , spoken in english , it translates to cantonese as ` Found Food ' . It 's the absolute BEST in ENTITY_singapore to me , i go there about once a month . It 's got a menu of pictures so it 'll be easy for you to pick . Enjoy !

Its pretty safe for you if you do n't go and look for them . The hotels there are pretty safe and if you are afraid of it , for Fragrance Hotels , try to stay at Balestier Road if you do afraid , as the area is safest and the only draw back will the transportation itself only , if you plan to take the ENTITY_MRT from hotel to other places .
