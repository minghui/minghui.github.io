It is very quiet and very pleasant . Plenty of foreigners who will leave you alone . The meal at the open air cafe is also reasonable . Next you can try all the restaurants in all the clubs , like the golf clubs , and the sailing clubs . There are too many that I have tried , but I like the open cafe at the Seletar Golf course . You need a car to go in because it is very deep in and far away from the public road . But the view of the cafe of this club is very nice , almost gives you a feeling of being abroad . Also try all the pubs in Boat Quay and along ENTITY_River_Valley_Road and ENTITY_Mohammed_Sultan_Road . They are usually crowded on weeknights , Friday nights , but not on Saturdays and Sundays . Because on Saturdays and Sundays , it is family day and everyone brings their kids to the hawker centres and the shopping centres of ENTITY_Singapore . They will not bring the children to these places full of pubs . So ok , do go and enjoy yourself . If you find all the places I recommend to your liking , please give me a vote . I need points to move up to the next level . Thanks in advance , but no pressure , OK ??
