People who work in town like ENTITY_Raffles_Place , ENTITY_Suntec_City or other city locations typically spend around $ 4 - $ 6 per day on a simple meal or around $ 10 - $ 20 for a better meal . Those who work in suburb areas spend lesser around $ 2 - $ 4 . On weekends or on special occations , that would be a different matter . Singaporeans really love food and do n't mind spending on food .
