Boat Quay / ENTITY_Clarke_Quay is good for a light night out , very westernised but good mix of travllers and locals . As well as many of the large ex pat community here . For really late drinking , try Circular Road -LRB- back of Boat Quay -RRB- , I have seen people falling out of bars here at 6am . Club street has a lot of pub and clubs and restaurants . It is not too commercial but a good vibe . If you are a guy seeking more of a ` boys night out ' environment try ENTITY_Geylang or ENTITY_Duxton_Rd. . Be careful how much you spend on those girls though as the bill will get out of control very quickly . Or there is always ENTITY_Orchard_Towers -LRB- also known as the 4 floors of whores -RRB- that can be a real eye opener to people visiting ENTITY_Asia for the first time . It is good for a laugh ! Basically ENTITY_Singapore night life goes off 7 days a week . It can be expensive though as the tax on alcohol is huge . A good night normally costs about $ 200 -LRB- includes bar snacks -RRB- but you can do a lot more than that if you are a pro ; - -RRB-
