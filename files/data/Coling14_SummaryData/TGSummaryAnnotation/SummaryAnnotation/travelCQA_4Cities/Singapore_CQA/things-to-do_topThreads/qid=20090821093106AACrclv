Unfortunately when we went , it rained the whole time so I missed out on ENTITY_Sentosa_Island . The country is safe to walk around and is quite fun . It can be hot and humid depending on when you go . As for best food , it depends on what you like to eat since there is a lot of different types of food . There is Chinese , Malay and Indian . I like the Chicken Rice that is served . ENTITY_Singapore is pretty famous for that dish . I would say that the Chinese restaurants and ENTITY_Indian restaurants should be able to cater to vegetarians since I know lots of Indians do not eat meat . Shopping you want to go to ENTITY_Orchard_Road . Lots of good shopping . If you are flying on ENTITY_Singapore_Airlines , you can get the ENTITY_Singapore Stopover Pass . If you go to ENTITY_Singapore Airline 's website , they can help you . The ENTITY_Singapore_Stopover_Pass gives you discounts on hotel stays and on many tourist attractions such as the Orchid Garden .
