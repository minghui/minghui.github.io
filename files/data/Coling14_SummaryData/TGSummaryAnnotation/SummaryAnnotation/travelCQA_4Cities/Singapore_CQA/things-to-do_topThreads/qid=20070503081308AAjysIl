Which works out to roughly £5 + and £8 + ? Not sure if it 's still the same price now though . As for beer , it depends on where you go to . Generally , beer is cheaper at the supermarkets , coffee shops and food centres , as compared to hotels and fine dining restaurants . The price for a 330ml can of beer ranges from S$ 2.50 to S$ 5 , depending on the brand . Beers in pubs and clubs are sold from S$ 10 onwards . For great deals , do check out the happy hours in most pubs and bars . You can do a currency conversion here : http://www.xe.com/
