ENTITY_Singapore also has its X'mas Sales in December , but not as grand as the ENTITY_Great_Singapore_Sale . Airtickets to ENTITY_Singapore and hotel stays is usually cheaper in June to September period , due to wowing more visitors , except for the period in or near National Day -LRB- August -RRB- . As for ENTITY_Hong_Kong , Winter time is the cheapest time to go to , as I always go there during Winter Season in ENTITY_Hong_Kong . Hotels and airticket are usually cheaper in January till March in ENTITY_Hong_Kong , due to lower influx of visitors to ENTITY_Hong_Kong . ENTITY_Hong_Kong sales season is usually July to September and December/January and sometimes into February -LRB- depends -RRB- .
