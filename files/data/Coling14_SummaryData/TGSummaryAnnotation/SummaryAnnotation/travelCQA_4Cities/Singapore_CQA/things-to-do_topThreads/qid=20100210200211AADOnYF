A budget hotel can cost you around S$ 50 to S$ 100 a night . Look at the list below . Be careful , however , many cheap hotels are located in the red light district . Avoid them -LRB- with * in the list -RRB- if you feel uncomfortable . A meal plus drinks in a hawker centres or coffee shops would cost you easily more than S$ 5 . So I 'll assume you would spend about S$ 20 a day on food . Going round on public transport is not expensive -LRB- see the second webpage below -RRB- , but a trip would cost you around S$ 2 . So be ready for S$ 10 for transportation . In other words , it would cost you about S$ 130 a day , and four days would be around S$ 500 .
