Thirty-six vegetarian restaurants are listed on VegDining.com , and you may have your pick . I think Genesis is a ENTITY_Western restaurant . You will find this website useful , as there are restaurant reviews submitted by people who have actually dined there . You may even get a membership card to avail of discounts at selected restaurants , and get access to interesting articles on the site .

If memory serves me correctly , it is on a street that runs parallel to the left of the ENTITY_Chinatown mall . The name seems to have escaped me at the moment .
