You 're coming to ENTITY_Singapore at the best time of the year -LRB- almost , heh -RRB- because we 're having the ENTITY_Great_Singapore_Sale . Make sure you come down to ENTITY_Orchard_Road , and you could shop 'til you drop . If you 're not the kind who like expensive stuff you could go to ENTITY_Bugis_Village , ENTITY_China_Town or ENTITY_Arab_Street . These little exotic places are a little more laid back and who knows what interesting things you may come across . Five days is n't a long time but perhaps one of those evenings you could visit the Night Safari that opens from 6pm to midnight . It 's the first night zoo in the world so you would n't want to miss it . I 've been there and I 'd go again . That 's one tourist spot I 'd recommend :-RRB- Getting around is easy because practically everywhere is accessible by public transport -LRB- s -RRB- . Especially the train . Have a good time here . And do n't forget to drink a lot .

Dining at ENTITY_Clarke_Quay -LRB- just besides ENTITY_singapore_River -RRB- Shopping at orchard Rd during ENTITY_Great_Singapore Sale !!! Attend events at Esplanade !!!
