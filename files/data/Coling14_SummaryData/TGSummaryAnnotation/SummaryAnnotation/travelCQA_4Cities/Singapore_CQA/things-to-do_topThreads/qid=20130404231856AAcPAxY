Costs around $ 50 each but well worth it . Book in advance and try to get a window table . Phone 6837 3322 . Once you 've done this you wo n't want to bother with the ENTITY_Singapore Flyer or ENTITY_MBS_Skypark . 2 -RRB- Go to the Night Safari . 3 -RRB- ENTITY_Singapore_City_Gallery at ENTITY_URA . Great for putting everything in context . Free . Then go for a wander around ENTITY_Chinatown . 4 -RRB- Go on a Nature Society tour . http://www.nss.org.sg/ Free and a real opportunity to visit somewhere off-the-beaten-track and have some genuine interaction with the locals . Does n't matter if you 're not usually a huge nature fan . 5 -RRB- If you 're there on a weekend evening , visit the outdoor theatre at Esplanade for free performances . Then take a walk up the ENTITY_Singapore_River .
