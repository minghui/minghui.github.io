A lot of europeans come here . There is also a more expensive place in the Hyatt Hotel called Mezza-nine with choices from fresh sushi to grilled angus beef , which is great . It has a lot of Asian and a lot of European food . For lunch a good place you could go to is the shopping mall Paragon . They have one very famous Soba noodle restaurant in the basement , a brilliant dumpling restaurant and a very casual ENTITY_Italian diner . Paragon houses a lot of great restaurants . For cheaper , quicker bites you could go to the food court in ENTITY_Takashimaya . At the very back of the food court is a really nice ENTITY_Japanese restaurant with great desserts ! If you crave good quality , good price Italian , head to the basement of the ENTITY_Hyatt hotel . It is called ENTITY_Pete 's Place and has lovely fresh pizzas made in front of you . They also have lots of bread selections and a delicious chocolate fondue dessert ! These are my favourite restaurants in ENTITY_Singapore , but I am sure you will also find great ones ! It 's a good idea to buy a restaurant guide , since they list loads of fab places to eat !
