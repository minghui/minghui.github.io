If you are riding in the front of the bus -LRB- aircraft -RRB- , no real problems . The newer entertainment units in Business Class & First Class have the on demand service . You can choose from TV shows , all kinds of movies and games . However if you are flying in the back , it 's another story . I would suggest taking a fully charged laptop and a movie or two . Own a iPod , good time to relax to some good tunes . If you have time , pick-up a tourist book on ENTITY_Singapore online or at your local book store , read it on the way over . Between eating , and all of this you should have enough time to take a good long nap ! As matter of fact I would suggest staying up the night before you leave , when you get on the plane remember your watch is 12 hours behind where you are going . Try to take your nap sometime after your normal time -LRB- in the new time zone -RRB- . This will help jump start the body to the time zone difference . Also if you are flying on an ENTITY_Asian owned airlines , you are in for a nice treat . However , it it 's an American own airlines ... you might want to pack a few good snacks if you are in the back . Up front has good snacks , but the back side lacks a LOT !

Unless you do n't mind a repeat of the music they have pre-recorded bring your own mp3 player . Go through as many movies/sitcoms/games / songs as you can take . Maybe start taking photos of the crew and see how many you can take before you are told to stop ... then if they do stop you , ask them for some cards to keep you busy again . Other than that , have you 're own little party and invite the person next to you , drink and dance in your seat till you get tired enough . See you in ENTITY_Singapore ! lol ...
