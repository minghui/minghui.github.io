I got a cheap deal with the four points Sheraton in NYC for $ 170 per night , but apart from that , ENTITY_Transportation costs dont seem too high , so have I passed the expensive bit ? I am only here for 3 days

I eat cheaper here in my neighborhood than I do when traveling to other cities .

However , there are cheap places to eat in NYC . I recommend going to ENTITY_Chinatown and having a first rate meal for not a lot of money . One favorite place of mine is ENTITY_New_York_Noodletown on the Bowery , just a block or so south of Canal Street . This little hole in the wall restaurant looks like nothing - bare tables , people who do n't speak a lot of English waiting on you , sometimes pretty brusquely ! However , the food is terrific ! They even got a great review in the Times a few years ago , something usually reserved for more formal restaurants . And it 's dirt cheap .

However , you 'll only be there 3 days so you wo n't be spending that much . You got a great deal on the hotel . You can get 1/2 price tickets if you want to see a Broadway show . Tickets to tourist attractions do n't cost too much . It 's worth every penny . Enjoy .

Really , your only costs will be food and entertainment , and you can set a reasonable budget for those .
