There are so many people and the atmosphere makes you feel so alive . If I were to stay in a hotel , I would stay in ENTITY_Jersey , because it 's cheaper , and then take a cab or drive to the city in the morning . Everything there is super expensive , but it 's so much fun just to walk around and look at everything . It 's beautiful .

They have a list of the hostels in ENTITY_NYC where you can stay around $ 20-30 a night . As far as eating ... it depends on what your looking for . Definitely wander around the Village or ENTITY_Soho , they have great cafes . OR you could wander around midtown and just pick a random pizza shop , particularly one with the owner 's name in it like ENTITY_Tony 's , ENTITY_Alfredo 's , etc. . OR you could do the touristy thing and eat at the megastore 's in Time 's Square like ENTITY_Bubba_Gump 's Shrimp company . If your willing to spend some money for a nice date , there is a famous -LRB- really nice -RRB- restaurant in Central Park called Tavern on the Green . I suggest buying a travel book if this is a extended vacation .

qid=20090214122948AAHl8qX_answer_11	2	qid=20090214122948AAHl8qX	2009-02-14 15:41:00	answer	 First of all , the word cheap does n't really exist in ENTITY_New_York_City , especially concerning places to stay . My suggestion for hotels is to stay across the river in ENTITY_New_Jersey and commute to ENTITY_Manhattan -LRB- you can take the train to get there -RRB- . For places to eat , that depends on what your tastes are . Being that this is ENTITY_New_York_City , you can literally get anything you want to eat , from fine dining , to oriental , to seafood , to casual diners , to bars and grills , and of course McDonald 's -LRB- and yes , there at least one ENTITY_Mickey_D 's about every two or thee blocks in ENTITY_Manhattan -RRB- ! My advice is to start with Times Square , which has tourist favorites like ENTITY_Planet_Hollywood , and ENTITY_Hard_Rock_Cafe , to things a little closer to home , like Red Lobster , and the Olive Garden . Be advised , however , that eating in ENTITY_Manhattan is fairly pricey overall -LRB- dinner for two at the Olive Garden at Times Square could run you about 55 bucks !!! -RRB- , so make sure you plan accordingly . Overall , there 's a LOT to see and a LOT to do in ENTITY_New_York , and there 's not nearly enough time for it all -LRB- Central Park , the Statue of Liberty , the Empire State Building , the Chrysler Building , Times Square , Ground Zero , Broadway Shows , ENTITY_Chinatown ... -RRB- . So plan ahead , be safe and enjoy !
