I 'd like the hotel to be in a safe and central location and although willing to splash out I really want to stay somewhere cool but reasonably priced . I 've seen the ENTITY_Hudson and wondered if this is a cool place to stay ?

A native ENTITY_New_Yorker came to my hotel , and based on what I had said were my interests , gave me a free , alternative tour of ENTITY_New_York . It was outstanding . You have to fill in a visitor request form online and they try and match you with someone . I stayed near Times Square for a week and to be honest , yes it was safe as it was always busy , but the absolute nicest area I saw was ENTITY_Soho . Fantastic shopping , beautiful buildings and right near Broadway . Afriad I do n't know the names of any hotels there though . In terms of shopping around ENTITY_Soho there are a couple of places of note - the area on and around Spring Street and ENTITY_Broome_Street . On Broome/Broadway is a colossal building called ENTITY_Pearl_River_Chinese Emporium which is a fascinating place to shop for everything Chinese from food to clothes , to homeware . It has smaller branches of a lot of the bigger stores around there , and within a street either way you can get everything from high end designer , to purse friendly fashion , all sorts of art and gift shops and plenty of places to stop for a coffee . My hotel was the Herald Square hotel , less than five mins walk from ENTITY_Macys and the ENTITY_Empire_State , very close to Times Square . It was a safe budget place for me as a solo female traveller , the staff were wonderfull , the rooms clean -LRB- if basic -RRB- and I would stay there again . Enjoy your holiday !

It has traveller reviews too qwhich is good because you get reviews from people that have actually stayed there . You get the real deal , not the BS the hotel wants you to hear . I found it very usefull , but you have to do your homework . Good luck !! : -RRB-

ENTITY_Penn_St._Station and a block from ENTITY_Maceys and all the other shops . The rooms all have fully equipped kitchens and with a deli right next door you can eat in if you want . The rooms are enormous and room 2410 even had a large balcony so it was amazing
