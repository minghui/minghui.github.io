They could hide anything in the topping or the crust . I have n't flown for many years . I hope to never fly again . I want my feet on the ground . Everything is too risky today for me . I 'm sure ENTITY_N.Y. pizzas are terrific . Most good size cities have great pizzas too . I wish I had gotten one when I was there .

The first pizzeria in ENTITY_America was founded right here in ENTITY_Brooklyn , and the NY area has the highest number of italians in the country , more italian immigrants live here than in ENTITY_Rome itself . Plus , we employ better techniques , better ingredients , and we have the best tap water in the east coast so we have better-tasting dough . The best pizzeria in ENTITY_america was actually found to be in ENTITY_arizona , but the owner and all the cooks were from the ENTITY_Bronx , and he shipped tapwater from NYC to make his dough .

The only pizzas in the ENTITY_U.S. that may come close are ENTITY_Chicago and ENTITY_Boston . But ENTITY_New_York ... it 's flavor is just spectacular !

NYC pizza is to die for , it 's thick and it 's so good I can just eat a plain old cheese slice , no sausage . I 'm now in ENTITY_California and I have to pile on stuff in order to feel I ate something good . ENTITY_Chicago is not far behind , I love their pizza too . I think part of the pizza greatness is the brick ovens they use there , it does make a difference . When I go to NY I also bring back White Castle hamburgers , I just love them . They are slightly larger than a 50 cent piece , so in order to satisfy my hunger I normally eat about 6-7 at one sitting . Someone bought some White Castle frozen burgers here , but they are not the same as the fresh ones .

qid=20080506010512AAqCKuK_answer_13	2	qid=20080506010512AAqCKuK	2008-05-06 10:01:01	answer	 Do n't get the pizza at the airport though ! Those are usually the big national chains -LRB- ENTITY_sbarro 's , pizza hut , etc. -RRB- or places similar , not real ENTITY_New_York pizza . I 'm sure there are some great places in ENTITY_Queens within about a 15 minute bus ride though . Well worth the trip just for the pizza if you have the time during a layover . Or you could just come here and experience not only our pizza , but also the chinese food , deli , bagels and other great food that 's either unique to ENTITY_New_York or only available in that quality in a handful of places in the world . Of the ones I listed , the chinese food is the only one you can get as good other places , but you have to go someplace like ENTITY_Seatle or ENTITY_Boston where they have a real ENTITY_Chinatown to get good ENTITY_American style Chinese food . American Chinese food is very different from the stuff you get in ENTITY_China . It started in ENTITY_Seatle when some guy wondered into ENTITY_Chinatown and they served him leftovers and he loved it . ENTITY_Chicago also has great pizza , but it 's an entirely different thing from ENTITY_New_York pizza and the two really should n't be compared . It 's like comparing cake and ice cream .
