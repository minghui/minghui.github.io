I 've never been to ENTITY_New_york , but I 've got a lot of respect for it , but the only thing is that for so damn long all you hear about is ENTITY_New_York this or ENTITY_LA that , Give another beautiful city a chance like ENTITY_Chicago where I am from . ENTITY_New_York is so damn overplayed and overused , and people are getting tired of seeing it in every movie or TV show for the past what 60/70 years ? . No disrespect to any New Yorkers who read this , but give the beautiful city of ENTITY_Chicago a chance to shine on its beautiful architecture and culture . We are great city !

And the fact that all the TV of film writers live in ether NY or ENTITY_LA. . My home , ENTITY_New_York , is a 24 hour metropolis that does n't know the meaning of the word stop . New york is statistically the most ethnically diverse city in the world . Foreigners come to ENTITY_America , where do they want to be ? ENTITY_New_York .

Then we run the risk of ENTITY_Chicago becoming like LA or NY and that is the LAST thing we need ! ENTITY_Chicago is called the second city as it is now the second as the first ENTITY_Chicago burned down . As everyone knows ENTITY_Chicago is second to no one at all !

qid=20100820120107AAT9EIo_answer_8	2	qid=20100820120107AAT9EIo	2010-08-21 16:26:04 +0000	answer	 ENTITY_Chicago us a great city too , , I agree . . The sky line is really something to see and the restaurants are amazing . . IT has a feeling of NY . but with ENTITY_Midwestern flavor . . The ENTITY_Lake is just spectacular at night and the beaches are pretty too . The regional differences are there however . . ENTITY_Chicago does not have the : `` Food stands '' that ENTITY_NY has and you ca n't get a Sabrett hot dog there either . . Also , they have something called a : '' Beef sandwich '' which is sliced beef that has been marinated in garlic and spices . IT 's really delicious but it 's regional exclusively for ENTITY_Chicago . . So , it 's what you like and what you are accustomed to . . As for the movies ... I have seen ENTITY_Chicago locations for movies too just not nearly as often ... I guess NY is Ny and always will be . ENTITY_Chitown does have its attractions too .
