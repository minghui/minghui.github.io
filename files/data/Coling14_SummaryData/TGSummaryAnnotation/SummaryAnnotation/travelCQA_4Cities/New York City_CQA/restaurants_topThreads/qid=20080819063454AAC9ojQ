It 's on East 44th , so is pretty central . All the major sights and attractions I visited were in walking distance , except Staue of ENTITY_Liberty and ENTITY_Bronx_Zoo . Room was on the 39th floor , and the views over ENTITY_Manhatten at night were absolutely stunning . All staff were pleasant and helpful . Room was huge . Costwise , it was $ 3100 , which is about Â£1700 in real money . Worth every penny .

The rooms are very basic , but if you ask to be put in the refurbished part they are better , we were put there after complainingg about our room , in fact there was no hassles getting changed because the staff are great . as I have already said the location makes up for everything else , and you will not spend a lot of time in your hotel anyway , also the restaurant attached to the hotel is great and there is some good ENTITY_Delis and restaurants in the area . ENTITY_Rosie_o'gradys -LRB- 3min walk towards Times Square -RRB- is excellent . We had a set 3 course dinner for $ 30 which included steak as one of the choices , and it was a lovely restaurant with very attentive staff . and we bought grayline tickets for the hop on hop of open top deck buses and there was a bus stop right opposite the hotel , this was a great thing to do because we seen everything we wanted to see at ease . tickets were bought in the hotel gift shop and the shop assistant advised us about everything . Hope you get something to your liking and enjoy your holiday . I wish I was going back right now !
