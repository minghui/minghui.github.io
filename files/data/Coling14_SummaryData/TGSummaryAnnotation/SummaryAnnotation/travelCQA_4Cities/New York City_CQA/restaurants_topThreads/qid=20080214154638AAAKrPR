ENTITY_Bergdorf 's is right down the block and they have great windows . Central Park is there too ... you can take a horse and carriage ride and walk up to ENTITY_Columbus_Circle and check out the cool mall over there . On Fifth Ave , the guys sell the purses that you might be looking for too ... If you 're going to stay in the village , go to ENTITY_Little_Italy -LRB- Mulberry Street -RRB- and eat at ENTITY_Casa_Bella ... they have the best food !! Have fun !
