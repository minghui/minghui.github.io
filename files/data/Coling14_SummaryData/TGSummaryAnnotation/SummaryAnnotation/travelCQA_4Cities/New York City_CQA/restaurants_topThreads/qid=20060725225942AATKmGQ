So , getting back to your original question . Mid-price . I 'll agree with the person who said ENTITY_Lucky_Chengs . It 's awesome . Also , the Brickstone -LRB- I think that 's what it 's called -RRB- , on 6th Street between 2nd and 1st Avenue has really amazing Indian food at a reasonable price . There are tons of other Indian places on 6th street and some of them have a sitar player , so you might want to choose one of those . ENTITY_Benihana is a Japanese-style grill where they cook in front of you . It is reasonably priced . You get a lot of food ! It is on 56th off of 6th Ave. And for cheap and awesome hot dogs ENTITY_Gray 's Papaya is quite the authentic NY experience . 2 hot dogs and a papaya drink for $ 2.75 For dessert go to the Bourgeois Pig on 7th Street between 1st Ave. and Avenue A . It is fondue -LRB- chocolate or cheese -RRB- and awesome sangria or just wine . It 's cheap and has a really nice ambiance .
