Start out with a stroll along Central Park in the morning . Afterwards , take a cab down 5th Avenue - east side of the park , -LRB- ask to go to 34th Street/Empire State Building -RRB- , to go to the Empire State Building and the observation deck . Along the way , you 'll see the 5th Avenue shops you 'll want to venture to later . After the Empire State Building , you can either cab it or take the `` B '' , `` D '' , `` F '' or `` V '' train to go to 47th-50th Sts . - ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center . One block to the east is 5th Avenue . Literally right across the street from ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center is ENTITY_Saks_Fifth_Avenue . Go further up on 5th to find other stores such as ENTITY_Tiffany 's , ENTITY_Bergdorf-Goodman , etc. . Then at night , go to Times Square -LRB- you can tell the cabbie Times Square and he SHOULD know what you 're talking about ... lol -RRB- . Eat at one of the trendy restaurants -LRB- Hard Rock , ENTITY_Bubba_Gump , ENTITY_ESPN_Cafe or Planet Hollywood -RRB- then walk around . You can visit Madame Tussaud 's Wax Museum if you want .

Start at the ENTITY_Empire_State building and work your way north . Get a good map of ENTITY_Upper_Manhattan and you 'll be set . Do n't forget to get to Times Square after dark - its amazing . Shopping is all over - 5th avenue has loads of shops and of course my favorite department store ENTITY_BLOOMINGDALES !!!! I should note that Central Park is HUGE and if your point is to just see it - you can hire a carriage for a short trip -LRB- 30 min -RRB- thru the park . If you have certain things to see in the park you should plan ahead a bit . Have fun !

Start at the Empire State Building -LRB- 34 St & 5th Avenue -RRB- , early to beat the crowds . From there up to Times Square -LRB- 42 St & Seventh Avenue -RRB- . You 'll want lunch in that area , as there are many wonderful and interesting foreign restaurants on side streets . Then walk over to Fifth Avenue and head uptown . You should have enough time to do some of Central Park , and possibly stop at ENTITY_FAO_Schwartz on 5th at 58 -LRB- enormous hands on toy store plus ice cream parlor -RRB- .

Let 's say you get to Central Park . It 's really big . You could n't see the whole thing in your entire life . So what do you go to see ? My favorite way to see Central Park is to go to the middle of the Park and then wander about . There are so many things to just happen on : the ENTITY_Belvedere_Fountain , boathouse , the dairy , and so on and so on . It 's a great place to get lost and find yourself again . You just ca n't do that on a schedule like that . Okay , just my opinion . But I 'd take more time than that .

You can visit all of them just by walking and you can divide them into three parts . Visit the Central Park in the morning , Empire State Building in the afternoon and Times Square during the night . There are many shopping areas in upper midtown , so do n't just go to those places , you can wonder around the area and you may end up a better bet than the Times Square .
