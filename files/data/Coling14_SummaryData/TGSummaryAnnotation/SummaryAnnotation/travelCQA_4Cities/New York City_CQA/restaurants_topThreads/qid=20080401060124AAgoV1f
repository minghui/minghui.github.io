The last time we visited we ate nothing but junk food -LRB- pizza , hot dogs , bagels , beef patties -RRB- , ENTITY_LOL , but it saved us a ton of money . We are anticipating doing the same this time but we are going with friends and would really like to visit one of NYâ€™s restaurants . Whatâ€™s a good restaurant that would be worth the waiting for a table and worth the price ? We are staying at the ENTITY_Hilton_Garden_Inn_Chelsea but we donâ€™t mind walking or taking cabs/trains . We are open to any kind of food except ENTITY_Spanish food . We live in ENTITY_Miami . A ENTITY_Latin_American restaurant here are like bodegas over thereâ€ ll over the place . Thanks !

Or you can go to one of the corner deli 's that has a salad bar . You fill up a container with your choices and they charge you by the weight of the contents of the container . There is a very good typical NY Greek diner on the south east corner of 23rd st and 9th ave. -LRB- not the one on the west side of 9th -RRB-

As an alternative , try going to an outer borough like ` ENTITY_Brooklyn ' . Short train ride to ENTITY_Sheepshead_Bay . The bay is great place to visit on Saturdays . Shopping , oogling , and dining . Also , the bay has at least two `` diners '' . Anyone will tell u that diners give you : Comfort , ENTITY_Great_Food , ENTITY_Too_Much_Food , and Great price . Just right for people on any kind of budget . Give it a shot . You 'll thank me .

It 's largely American food , but very creative and served well . Nothing fancy about the place -- the tables are small and close together , but it 's distinctly ENTITY_New_York and patronized almost exclusively by native New Yorkers . Prices are n't bad either ! ENTITY_Penelope should be only about a five minute walk from your hotel .

Also , if you walk by a restaurant and see that it is zagat rated , you 'll know it is good . NYC is so dense - there are good restaurants all over . In ENTITY_Chelsea - I like le singe vert on 7th Ave , Intermezzo on 8th Ave and Othello on 20th . For ENTITY_Little_Italy I 'd reccomend La ENTITY_Mela . Try Josies for ENTITY_Healthy_Gourmet_Food . While we are talking about gourmet - do n't miss zabars . It is a great gourmet food store on the upper west side . Do you want the best Steak dinner ever ? Go to ENTITY_Peter_Lugers_Steak house in ENTITY_Brooklyn . Definately worth the price and trip and wait . If you really want to spend some money , go to one if by land in ENTITY_Greenwich_Village on ENTITY_Barrow_Street . Also - for all these places - I 'd call for reservations in advance . --------------------- The ENTITY_Hollywood diner on 6th and 16th in ENTITY_Chelsea is not an exclusive place like the places I mentioned above , But it is darn good food that wo n't cost an arm and a leg and it is open 24 hours and it is in ENTITY_Chelsea where you will be staying .

Small -LRB- `` cozy '' -RRB- , very ENTITY_Greenwich Village-y . Meskerem-Right across from Cafe Reggio Amazing Ethiopian . Husband had the lamb in a honey wine , I had chicken in red wine . More than enough to share . Lunch only $ 8 . Little ENTITY_Poland in the ENTITY_East_Village_Mom-and-pop restaurant . Food is like it 's homemade . I had the pierogi special -LRB- & could n't finish , $ 10 -RRB- . Opted for here over ENTITY_Veselka because it was more low key , less crowded , & more affordable . ENTITY_Gramercy_Cafe in Gramercy/Union Square The omelette 's looked impressive but I opted for the huge lox-cream cheese-veggies-bagel & loved it . They have a big menu . Open 24-hrs . ENTITY_M_&_I_International_Foods in ENTITY_Brighton_Beach_Knishes . That 's all I have to say . Worth the train ride . It 's a grocery store w/a lunch counter on one side , a buffet in the back , & a restaurant upstairs . Cafe Euroasia in ENTITY_Brighton_Beach The borsh is really great . And the `` kiev '' -LRB- but dill & butter instead of brocolli & cheese -RRB- .
