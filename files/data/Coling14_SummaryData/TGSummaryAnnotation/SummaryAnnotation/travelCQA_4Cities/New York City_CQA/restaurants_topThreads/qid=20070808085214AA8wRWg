Great bar , the food is < of course > incredible as you KNOW it had to be great if they gave him his own TV show ! For the quality food you will get it is not expensive at all & I recommend the steamers . They have something like 9 styles , all huge servings , and after eating most of them I would order the ENTITY_Portuguese style . . with chorizo bits and spicy enough to make your lips sorta swell and feel burning as you get so many . So you get to brag about where you ate , have gourmet food and a GREAT bar experience AND see the WTC site only a few blocks away < as is ENTITY_Chinatown , & ENTITY_South_St_Seaport AND the ENTITY_Hudson_River and lower NY bay . You can also take a ride on the ENTITY_Staten_Island ferry . . cheap , beautiful and a time filler so the whole evening or afternoon is filled for not a heap of money ... Oh yeah , ENTITY_Tony_Bourdain is the man ! PS / If you see a fine looking interracial couple eating there . . he looks like ENTITY_Tiger_Woods_& she has long thick bushy beautiful hair to the waist say Hi to them , ENTITY_Kim_&_Michael , & tell them the Ryverwytch sent you there . His Mom is my bestest friend and it was they that first treated me to a meal there . . Bless their lil hearts . . Remember steamers or steak for the best meal < & the fries ... ummm I mean pommes frittes are smokin ' too ! LOL > Be there or be square !
