Bars/Lounges Spring lounge on Mulberry and Spring : It 's like a neighborhood bar in the middle of downtown . Gatsby 's on Spring and ENTITY_Lafayette : Pretty cool scene , nothing too special but I always seem to have fun here . ENTITY_Tai on Mulberry between Prince and Spring : Small , dark , intimate . . All are within walking distance of one another . For eating : ENTITY_Balthazar on Spring and Crosby : One of the best restaurants in the city L'asso on ENTITY_Mott and ENTITY_Kenmare : Hip , laid back , unique place . Incredible pizza like nothing you 've ever seen before . And all these places are within steps of one another . The ENTITY_Little_Italy part of Mulberry Street is touristy , but the food is good . I reccomend ENTITY_La_Mela .
