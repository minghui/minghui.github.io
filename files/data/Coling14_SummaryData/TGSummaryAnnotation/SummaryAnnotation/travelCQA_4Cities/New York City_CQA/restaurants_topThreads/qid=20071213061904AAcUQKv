I have been told by a lot of my friends that when they went to NYC that there was a lot of people selling fake purses . i want to know where they supposedly sell them at , i have heard china town , i have heard that they have actual stores that you can go in and they will make them in front of you just for you . here in ENTITY_Florida we have little places called flea markets , and that is where they sell them here . is that what what ENTITY_china town is like ? and where is the best places to look for replica bags ?

Right along ENTITY_Canal_Street , you 'll find a lot of shops that sells , fake purses and bags . You can buy a fake Rolex watch . Now , there is a word of warning , if you 're going to Canal Street , make sure you have an entire day to yourself , because , since the sale fake items is illegal , and the cops dose crackdown and arrest vendors for this type of infraction , many vendors tend to move from one place to another just to stay a step ahead of the cops . So there will be plenty of walking involve , but most of them have a store front . In the end you will be able to get the bag or purse you wanted , but a a bargain price , and that 's even better than the ones on 5th Avenue , or the flea market . I hope this information was very helpful , happy shopping .

But the better made knock offs -LRB- possibly even stolen items -RRB- were not in stores for public view . These are `` hidden '' in warehouse-type buildings . As you walk down the street , the people who want to sell these `` better '' purses will just walk up to you and ask if you want to go and see the bags . They 'll say it kind of under their breath . If you agree , they 'll have you follow them to the `` warehouse '' building which typically has no windows . Then you pay cash . It 's definitely a shady situation , but that 's how I got my -LRB- possibly knock-off , possibly stolen -RRB- Coach bag !

ENTITY_Chinatown is a maze of small stores that will have the bags hanging on walls . You 'll be able to see them from the sidewalk - most of the stores are less than 10 feet deep .

In warmer weather , people sell various things on street corners . The only problem with buying knockoffs is to make sure it does n't smell . If they 're selling them outside , sometimes to ca n't tell . My friend bought a knock off purse and after it sat in her hotel room for a couple hours , she realized it smelled like mildew .
