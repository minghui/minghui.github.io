Yes , you can go to a ENTITY_Yankee 's game . But your question is too general -LRB- other than the part about the ENTITY_Yankee 's game -RRB- to generate any real answers . This is too large and complex a city for you to ask general questions like this . What kind of food do you like ? Where will you be staying ? What kinds of things do you want to buy ? What kinds of stores interest you ? Give us some info about what you are really interested in , and we can advise you . But NYC is BIG . There are too many variables here .

Cost about $ 150 per seat the the food is outrageous . Eat before you go and enjoy a cup of coffee . Go to ENTITY_Katz 's ENTITY_Deli on ENTITY_E._Houston . It 's where the orgasm scene in When ENTITY_Harry_Met_Sally was filmed and the food is very good . Also , for great ENTITY_Italian food , head to ENTITY_Little_Italy and eat dinner at Angelo 's . During he day you can have a pasta at any of the bistros along 146 Mulberry Street . Around the corner you 'll find great pastries at ENTITY_Ferrara 's . Buy tickets before you leave ENTITY_England for ENTITY_Tony and ENTITY_Tina 's Wedding . It 's an interactive play just off Broadway . Have fun with it . I did and the cast invited me to the after-party . Fun stuff . The Empire State Building will take a hour and a half to get through security . I do n't like to wait . Loads of ENTITY_Jazz_Clubs about and the Blue Note in the Village always has world class entertainment . You might try The ENTITY_Birdland -LRB- ENTITY_Charlie_Parker 's place -RRB- . More Jazz .
