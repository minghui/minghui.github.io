qid=20080210002700AA9S93w_answer_1	1	qid=20080210002700AA9S93w	2008-02-10 06:21:44	best_answer	 You do n't have to make the choice as ENTITY_Little_Italy is completely surrounded by Chinatown.What has happened over the years is that ENTITY_Chinatown has gotten a lot larger and ENTITY_Little_Italy has gotten a lot smaller . ENTITY_Little_Italy has basically been squeezed into narrow rectangle that has the ENTITY_N/S_Mulberry_St. running right up the middle of it Your best subway stop is the one on Broadway and Canal because you can reach it from Penn Station -LSB- walk over to ENTITY_Herald_Square and take the N , R , W trains to Canal -RSB- or Grand Central -LSB- Take the 4 , 6 trains to Canal -RSB- Little ENTITY_Italy will be east if you . What 's east ? Scan the sky and find the Empire State Building . If you 're facing it , your right hand is on the east side of you Are you going to be doing this by yourself bc one NYC 's great pizzerias - ENTITY_Lombardi 's - is on Spring and ENTITY_Mott the problem is that they only sell whole pies Enjoy your trip

Over the past few years , ENTITY_Little_Italy has shrunk as ENTITY_Chinatown has grown . Today , ENTITY_Chinatown has almost taken over ENTITY_Little_Italy . There is some attempt to preserve just a few blocks of ENTITY_Little_Italy these days , but that 's about it . It 's just a little tourist area , with only a few restaurants and cafes left . Meanwhile ENTITY_Chinatown has grown pushing past it 's original bounderies . ENTITY_Chinatown is a thriving neighborhood today . ENTITY_Little_Italy is n't . But they are VERY close to each other -LRB- yes , today it DOES seem like ENTITY_Little_Italy is actually IN ENTITY_Chinatown , though it used to be north of ENTITY_Chinatown . -RRB- You could easily see them on the same day .

qid=20080210002700AA9S93w_answer_7	2	qid=20080210002700AA9S93w	2008-02-10 02:27:52	answer	 The last post is correct , both ENTITY_Chinatown and ENTITY_Little_Italy are right next to each other . I believe the Bowery , which is the name of the street , is the dividing line between ENTITY_Chinatown and ENTITY_Little_Italy . And if you taking the subway , any line will take you to Canal Street . Good luck and enjoy you trip .

qid=20080210002700AA9S93w_answer_10	2	qid=20080210002700AA9S93w	2008-02-10 06:10:36	answer	 ENTITY_Little_Italy is just a block north of ENTITY_Chinatown . Actually it 's not worth eating there , there are tons of better Italian Restaurants in NYC . Little ENTITY_Italy is a vestigial tourist trap . If you want to see an Italian Community in NYC , I suggest ENTITY_Bensonhurst in ENTITY_Brooklyn or ENTITY_Arther_Ave in the ENTITY_Bronx . If you must eat in little ENTITY_Italy go to ENTITY_Forlini 's .
