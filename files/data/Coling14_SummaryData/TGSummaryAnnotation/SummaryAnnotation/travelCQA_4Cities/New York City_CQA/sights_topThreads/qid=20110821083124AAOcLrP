Therefore , there 's no need for you to worry about going it out at night . Second , the best place to the city 's skyline will be from several location . ENTITY_Brooklyn_Promenade_Brooklyn_Bridge_Circle_Line boat at night ENTITY_State_Island_Ferry on its return trip from ENTITY_Staten_Island , which is one of the five boroughs of ENTITY_New_York_City . Please note , the ENTITY_Brooklyn Promenade closes after sunset , just like any park in the city . Therefore , I would suggest going in it in the day . Good luck

The area , which is now a favorite spot to view the ENTITY_New_York skyline , was once a busy industrial area and later a decaying dump site . Today , the park consists of over 1,000 acres of green space . The park also offers picnic facilities , a playground , and several monuments . The biggest attraction is the ENTITY_Liberty_Science_Center , a museum that contains an Omni Theater and several floors of science related exhibits . Many postcard pictures of the ENTITY_New_York_City skyline are taken from ENTITY_Liberty_State_Park .

The park was once a parking lot and to this day New Yorkers refer to ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge_Park as ` Main Street Lot . ' In addition to offering unobstructed views of downtown ENTITY_Manhattan and the Empire State Building , the park also features acres of land for picnicking and sporting activities as well as a large playground .

ENTITY_New_York is safe at night , provided you show common sense : stay away from a handful of slum areas , do n't wander side streets by yourself very late at night , do n't flash large amounts of cash -- things like that . The major street crime problems have largely gone away .

It 's the most romantic view of the skyline you can find . Btw , ENTITY_Native_New_Yorker is wrong about the closing hours for the promenade . It does not close at sunset . I knew that was wrong , since I 've been there many times at night , and there were always many people there . The actual closing hour is 1 a.m. And it is not a regular park , it does n't belong to the ENTITY_Parks_Department , but rather to the ENTITY_Department_of_Transportation , since it was created by the building of the B.Q.E. Anyway , it is a lovely site . And the view of ENTITY_Manhattan can not be matched .
