We 're planning a family trip to ENTITY_NYC soon and I 'm wondering what things are `` must see '' in ENTITY_NYC since our trip will only be 5 days long . We 've never been to NYC and I know that there 's a ton of things to do . I 'm not really interested in cramming everything into 5 days -LRB- not that I could anyway -RRB- . We 're staying in a hotel near Times Square . Tell me your favorite things about NYC . Any help or tips would be appreciated .

It is really cool and fun to be in there , you would enjoy the shops , ice skating rink , museums , and the city itself . I also would suggest you to visit Time Square and Broadway Theater . There are awesome areas and places in ENTITY_New_York_City . You will love it ! Enjoy !

Make sure you go to the Metropolitan Museum , the Empire State Building , and at least one Broadway show . NYC is wonderful for walking ... take a walk around and stop where you want . Take a tour bus , take a boat ride around the city . Have a wonderful time .

Also , I guess , the Empire State Building . Like the stereotype about new yorkers , I 've never been up there , but anywhere where you can get a view of the skyline is really amazing -LRB- look when or if you 're flying in -- there 's nothing like that skyline to let you know you 're home -RRB- . I guess the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge would be the ideal skyline view and you can walk across it if you want , but I do n't necessarily reccomend that , but if you like walking , why not . Also , definitely go through Times Square . If you needed more motivation I live there and it 's great , even though I probably do n't go past a quarter of what you ahould see . BTW , if you 're staying at the ENTITY_Carter , my cousins stayed there a few years ago and I visited their room and it was pretty disgusting -- dirt in the sink and stuuff like that . so heads up .

Lower ENTITY_Manhattan -- World Trade Center site ; ENTITY_Ellis_Island and ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty -LRB- same boat , one price , EXTREMELY long lines form , so be at the ticket booth well before 9 a.m. -RRB- ; ENTITY_South_Street_Seaport ; Wall Street ; ENTITY_Chinatown -LRB- eat at Wo Hop on Mott Street -RRB- Midtown -- ENTITY_United_Nations -LRB- gift shop has no sales tax -RRB- ; Times Square is the theater district , and there are many interesting restaurants on side streets ; ENTITY_Empire_State_Building ; ENTITY_Rockefeller Center/Radio City Music Hall ; Museum of Modern Art -LRB- ENTITY_MoMA -RRB- window shopping along Fifth Avenue , 50 to 58 Streets Uptown -- Central Park and Zoo ; ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art ; ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural History/Rose Space Center

ENTITY_New_York does not have many outdoor attractions or amazing things like ancient history . Therefore , not much to do . In ENTITY_New_York is all about have a meal , a drink and spend time with someone . If you need help , you may contact me . Good luck .
