Like ENTITY_Richard said , the price is only a `` suggested '' price -- toss them a quarter , if you 're nice , and keep it moving . There 's so much to see in there that you can not see it all in one shot . Also , go to Battery Park at the end of ENTITY_Manhattan . It would be a great photo-op as the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty is within close view . Furthermore , every summer , there is a River to River Festival in lower ENTITY_Manhattan . It features free live music and things of that nature . Check it out at http://www.rivertorivernyc.com/ . And , there 's Broadway in ENTITY_Bryant_Park , which is a free lunchtime event that consists of live performances of songs from various Broadway musicals .

To relax , try having a picnic at Central Park . http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/laboâ€?we chose to eat at the top of one huge rock there to have e good view of the whole central park :-RRB- then , we went to MET -LRB- entrance is by donation only , you do n't have to give 20 USD -RRB-
