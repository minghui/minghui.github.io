Sounds a bit depressing , but if you 're historically inclined , the Ground Zero site is an intereresting spot also . Hopefully , the next time you return it will be redeveloped and totally unrecognizable . Also an art lover , you should not miss the Metropolitan Museum . For neighborhood atmosphere and people watching ENTITY_Washington_Square_Park and surrounding neighborhood is fun
