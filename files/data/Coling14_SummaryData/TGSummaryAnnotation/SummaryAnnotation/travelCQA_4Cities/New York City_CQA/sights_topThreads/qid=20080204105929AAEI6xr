Governors Island is new national park island in ENTITY_Upper_New_York_Bay . There 's free ferry goes from Slip 7 adjacement to ENTITY_Staten_Island Ferry building . http://www.govisland.com/Visit_the_Islanâ€?It only opens on Weekend . On weekdays , only two days are with TOURIST guide only access . Also , Big Taxi Tours which is open-roof double decker bus and it is cheap than either Grayline or CitySight ENTITY_New_York . It only cost $ 25 . I not sure if Uptown Loop is operating yet . Also , in Summer , if you like to get wet , take ride on ENTITY_New_York Splash Tour . It is similar to Duck Tour in ENTITY_Boston and ENTITY_Philadelphia . Another best place to do in ENTITY_New_York , especially during Summer , go to Playland Amusement Park in Rye , ENTITY_New_York . ENTITY_MTA_Metro-North and ENTITY_MTA Long Island Railroad give One Day Giveaway if you go from NYC . Also , ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art just reopen new 19-20th ENTITY_St_Century_Painting_&_Sculptures_Galleries on 2nd Floor ; ENTITY_New_Greek_&_Roman Galleries , French Decoration in European Scuplture Garden on 1st floor . In summer , there will be rotating special exhibition on Roof Garden . If you like old train or bus , ENTITY_New_York_City_Transit_Museum in ENTITY_Downtown_Brooklyn is also best to visit .
