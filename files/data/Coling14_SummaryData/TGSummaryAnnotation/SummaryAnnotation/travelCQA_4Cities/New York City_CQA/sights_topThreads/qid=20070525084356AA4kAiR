It is right by Central Park , so when you are finished go for some ice cream in the park . Have fun and good luck !

Take her to ENTITY_FAO_Schwartz at 58 ENTITY_St_&_Fifth_Avenue . Enormous toy store with an ice cream parlor . Perhaps the first stop should be Central Park and its zoo are very convenient -LRB- just north of 59 Street -RRB- . With a 7 year old to accompany you , you will be able to get into the Children 's section of the zoo , with lots of petting animals , many of them babies born this Spring . Then ENTITY_FAO_Schwartz , since I doubt you would want the ice cream parlor early in the day . With meals and travel time , this may use up most of your day . If not , the ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History and Rose Space Center -LRB- includes Hayden Planetarium -RRB- are on the west side of Central Park at 79-81 Streets .

You should definitely go to Toys ` R ' Us in ENTITY_Town_Square and have a picnic at Central Park . Finish off the day with a Broadway show . She 's probably goin to prefer one based on a Disney movie -LRB- Beauty and the ENTITY_Beast , The Lion King , etc. . -RRB-
