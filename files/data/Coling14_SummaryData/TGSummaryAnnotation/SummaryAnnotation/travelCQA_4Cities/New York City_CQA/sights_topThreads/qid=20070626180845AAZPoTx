There 's a lot to see and cover , and you only have 3 days . What do you like ? Check out the ENTITY_Wall_Street area and see where the `` money gets made and exchanged '' . ENTITY_Chinatown and ENTITY_Little_Italy are within walking distance too . That could be your first day . Second day I would go to the Village and check out ENTITY_Washington_Park where part of ENTITY_NYU is spread out over and then Central Park by 5th Avenue in the 50 's , where the tony -LRB- meaning fancy -RRB- stores are like ENTITY_Tiffanys . Then I would check out the Spirit of ENTITY_New_York boat ride , and take a couple of hours going around ENTITY_Manhattan and seeing the infamous skyline . At Sunset I would check out the ENTITY_South_Street_Seaport . Third day , try to check out some museums if you wish , we have plenty ! There 's the ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art and the ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History for starters . I would say to check out Times Square but I think you 'll be exhausted by then . Times Square can get claustrophobic with the glut of tourists roaming and clogging the streets .

I really suggest a tour bus . You 'll do a lot of things and see a lot of places you just cant get around to doing by yourself . ENTITY_Coney_Island is questionable , I think you should do something else ... See a good play . ENTITY_New_York is famous for plays . ENTITY_Best_Pizza in ENTITY_New_York is my opinion is ENTITY_John 's Pizza . Its by ENTITY_Times_Sqaure and Broadway .

It will bring you to different stops and mostlikely you can walk to your location form one of the stops . Plus your up high so you can have a wonderful view and dont forget to check out time square ! have a blast !!
