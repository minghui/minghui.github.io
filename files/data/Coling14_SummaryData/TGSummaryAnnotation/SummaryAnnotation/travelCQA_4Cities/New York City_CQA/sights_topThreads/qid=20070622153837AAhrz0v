I do n't think I had any family come thru there , but I found it inspiring all the same . This was 10 years ago . It would be interesting to go thru again today , what with immigration being such a hot topic . Plus you get a free ride pass the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty !

You 'll be greeted by the ENTITY_Sony robot and it 's totally free . It 's fun especially when you 're broke as a joke !

However , just limiting ourselves to museums in ENTITY_Manhattan : ENTITY_Dyckman_House_Museum -LRB- ENTITY_British_Army_HQ in the Revolution -RRB- The Cloisters -LRB- most beautiful spot in NYC , medieval -RRB- ENTITY_Hamilton_Grange -LRB- home of ENTITY_Alexander_Hamilton -RRB- ENTITY_American_Museum_of_Natural History/Rose Space Center -LRB- one of the world 's premier museums , Rose includes Hayden Planetarium -RRB- Metropolitan Museum of ENTITY_Art_Guggenheim -LRB- specializes in modern art -RRB- Frick Museum of Modern Art -LRB- ENTITY_MoMA -RRB- Museum of the City of ENTITY_New_York -LRB- local history -RRB- Museum of Broadcasting Museum of Sex -LRB- for real ! -RRB- The other boroughs have worthy museums , like the only Tibetan museum in the ENTITY_United_States . You should get out and around for these also .

They 're closed Mondays and are particularly crowded on weekends , so go Tuesday through Friday if you can . The Cloisters , the Met 's strictly-medieval branch , is generally less crowded . Take the A to 190th Street , and walk or take the M4 bus . The ENTITY_Brooklyn_Museum_of_Art is worth a road trip -- ENTITY_Brooklyn is , after all , a part of ENTITY_New_York_City . Depending on where you 're staying , it may even be a shorter trip than , say , the Cloisters or the Met . I think they offer a joint pass with the ENTITY_Brooklyn Botanical Gardens next door .

I would also suggest you roam around ENTITY_Chelsea because there are a lot of `` off the beaten track '' galleries in that neighborhood . I would highly suggest going there ; you 'll get a more unique perspective of art down there .
