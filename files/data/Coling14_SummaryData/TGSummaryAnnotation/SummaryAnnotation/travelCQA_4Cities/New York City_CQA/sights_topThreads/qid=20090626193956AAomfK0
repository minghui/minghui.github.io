Then take a Q train out to ENTITY_Brooklyn . It will take you all through ENTITY_Brooklyn . Try to go to ENTITY_Brighton_Beach , it 's really nice in July . And its an ethnic neighborhood , ENTITY_Russian . I live here actually . It 's right next to a few other landmarks that most people have n't visited like the Cyclone and ENTITY_Parachute_Drop . Maybe stick around to watch the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Cyclones play ? Tix are only 10 dollars ! That 's a whole days itinerary right there . And if you go on a Friday , there are fireworks here . Let me know if you like any of the suggestions or want more . My email is ekon32@verizon.net Goodbye !

I 'm partial to the Central Park Zoo . It 's small but its really pretty with some cool animals . The kids would love ENTITY_FAO_Schwartz ... a big toy store ... or check out ENTITY_Dylans_Candy_Store ... which is really cool and has a great selection of candy and ice cream .

Thr train will put you inyto midtown at either Grand Central , one of our true icons , or ENTITY_Penn_Station . Either way you are within about a fifteen minute walk to Times Square . The Empire State Building is even closer , five minutes from ENTITY_Penn_Station an d about ten from ENTITY_Grand_Central . To take a trip to the statue of ENTITY_Liberty would take about half the time that you have in town . You can get a good view of it from Battery Park on the southern tip of ENTITY_Manhattan , A closer view can be had from the ENTITY_Staten_Island Ferry which will take you both ways across the harbor for free . You can also see the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge from there , albeit not too close . The ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History is popular . Recognize it from the ENTITY_Ben_Stiller movie . There is also the recently modernized planetarium attached . To get here take the uptown C train to the stop named for the museum at west 81st street . Central Park is right across the street and the Zoo is almost directly across the park . Walk down to about 72 street to enter the park at ENTITY_Strawberry_Field , the tribute to ENTITY_John_Lennon who lived , and sadly died , right across the street . Cheap iconic NY eats can be had at Gray 's Papaya at Seventh Ave and 37th street , conveniently located between the ENTITY_Empire_State and Times Square . Better and cheaper and less risky than the corner hot dog cart . Another icon is ENTITY_Manganaro 's Hero boy at Ninth Ave and 37th street . Italian Style plates and heroes for eighty years . Best way around town is the subway . You can get a map when you get on or download one at mta.info Drop me a line for more details or suggestions .
