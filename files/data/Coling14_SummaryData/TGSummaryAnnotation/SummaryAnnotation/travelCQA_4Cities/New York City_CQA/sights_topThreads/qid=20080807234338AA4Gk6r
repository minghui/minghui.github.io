There you can find cool little shops and restaurants and take great pics LITTLE ENTITY_ITALY and ENTITY_CHINATOWN The best Italian food and Chinese food you will find along with incredible atmosphere THE STATUE OF LIBERTY , GROUND ZERO , EMPIRE STATE BUILDING Tourist attractions but worth it and not to be missed ROCKEFELLER CENTER It is the heart of all that is broadcasting and there you can stop in to look at The Rainbow Room Restaurant even if you can not afford to eat there . CENTRAL PARK Stop into Tavern on the Green to look around . Also , go to ENTITY_John_Lennons memorial in the park which is accross from his old apartment in ENTITY_THE_DAKOTA building ENTITY_MACY 'S HERALD SQUARE You have probably been to ENTITY_Macy_'s but none like this . You will see EVERY designer latest work and great windows . Plus you will get a great look at the heart of the garment district . THE WEST VILLAGE Always funky and cool ... get off at the Christopher street subway stop . TIMES SQUARE Make it a fast see ... . it is a neon explosion and the center of NY THE CIRCLE LINE Have your mom take you on the ferry around the island ... it is a great view of where you are at . Walk , walk walk ... ... stop in everywhere and do n't eat too much anywhere so you can try EVERYTHING . Ask people for suggestions on the street and be sure to get on the subway -LRB- it is very safe so do n't worry -RRB- . Stay out LATE and walk into any place that is playing good music or smells great ! LOL You will remember this all your life . Good luck friend ! You reminded me of my life there .
