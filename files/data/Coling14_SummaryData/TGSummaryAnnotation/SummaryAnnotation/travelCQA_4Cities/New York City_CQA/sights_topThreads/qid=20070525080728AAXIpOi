Some of the museums require a full day all to themselves , and the boat to the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty and ENTITY_Ellis_Island will kill a major part of a day unless you do n't get off at either one -- and what would be the point of that ? I 'll list a few of the things to see just in ENTITY_Manhattan , grouped by area . You 'll have to pick and choose from that . But you are bound to miss a lot , especially considering ENTITY_Manhattan is only one of the five boroughs , and next to smallest . Lower ENTITY_Manhattan : World Trade Center site ; boat to Statue of ENTITY_Liberty/Ellis_Island ; Wall Street ; ENTITY_Fraunces_Tavern ; ENTITY_Chase_Bank_Money_Museum ; ENTITY_Chinatown ; ENTITY_South_Street_Seaport_Midtown : theater district ; Empire State Building ; ENTITY_United_Nations -LRB- gift shop is great for souvenirs -RRB- ; Fifth Avenue shopping district ENTITY_Uptown ; ENTITY_Central_Park and Zoo ; ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art ; ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural History/Rose Space Center . There 's more in ENTITY_Manhattan , but you ca n't possibly do what I listed in two days , so why bother ?

Just pick the ones that you want to see the most and hit those . Lay them out so you do n't spend too much time traveling over the same area twice . The subway is your friend ...

Then we pick out the one thing we want to see the most - and evenrything else is a bonus ! If you have children with you , consider starting at ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center - ENTITY_Nintendo_Store is there beside of TODAY show airing , ENTITY_St_Patricks is just a block away and the TOP of the ROCk at RC offers great views of skyscrapers and Central Park -LRB- lines are not as long as ENTITY_Empire_State - better picture opps as well ! -RRB- .

Times Square area has lots of kid friendly shows with ENTITY_Lion_King , ENTITY_Mary_Poppins , Wicked and Beauty and the ENTITY_Beast , ENTITY_Chinatown for shopping , carriage ride near Central park , afternoon can be spent at lower ENTITY_Manhattan for walking tour of Wall Street , Ground Zero , Battery Park and ENTITY_South_Street_Seaport .

Make a plan for what tourist sites you want to go and what trains to take . Train system may look confusing at first but its not that bad ; the colors of each line designate what avenue it runs on . For example the B , D , F , Q are all orange -LRB- they all travel on 6th Ave. -RRB- , the 4 , 5 , 6 are green -LRB- they all travel on East Side down Lexington/Park Ave. -RRB- .

I believe they say `` New York Sightseeing '' somewhere on the side . You can sit on the top part of the bus in the open air and get a clearer view of ENTITY_New_York than you would if you just walked around . They should take you to see all the major points of interest . However , in two days it would be difficult to fully appreciate all that ENTITY_New_York has to offer . I suggest that you go to ENTITY_New_York and see all the major tourist stites just to get a feel for what they are like . Then , return to ENTITY_New_York whenever you can and go to the places that you are the most interested in .

Like day one go downtown and catch the ferry to the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty , and ENTITY_Ellis_Island , after that go see ground Zero , walk to Wall St and tour the Exchange , have dinner at S. Street Seaport . Day Two tour Mid-town - go to the Empire State building , check out ENTITY_Tiffany_'s , ENTITY_FAO_Schwartz , take a walk in Central park - see the world famous Zoo , window shop on fifth ave and have dinner in some out of the way place -LRB- I like to choose the 5th restaurant I see - that way I have no re-conceived notions of what to expect . Completely random and usually wonderful -RRB- You can change this around to suit your tastes . Ask someone at the hotel what is to see in the area . Have fun , wear comfortable shoes and good luck !
