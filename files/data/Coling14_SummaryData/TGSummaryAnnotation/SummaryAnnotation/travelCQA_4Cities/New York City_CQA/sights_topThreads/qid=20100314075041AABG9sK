There is a day of performance discount place called TKTS at Broadway and 47th street . Arrive early . Do n't be dissuaded by the long line . Once the windows open it will move well . We have severeal great museums dedicated to many things . Beside general interest museums like the Met and ENTITY_Natural_History there are specific interest museums like ENTITY_NYPD , ENTITY_FDNY , ENTITY_New_York , ENTITY_New_York_Historical_Society , Money , Sex , Skyscrapers , ENTITY_American_Art , ENTITY_Folk_Art , Modern Art , etc. . That Wax Museum in Times Square ? Not so much . Make sure you get to sample our iconic foods . Hot dogs from a street cart , Hot Dogs from a Papaya place , ENTITY_China town , ENTITY_Little_Italy , Pizza from a good place . Avoid chains like ENTITY_Hard_Rock , Olive Garden etc. . Ditto tourist places like the Stardust Diner . From Times Square , if you venture two blocks west you will find dozens of restaurants along Ninth Ave where NYers eat . Better food , better value .
