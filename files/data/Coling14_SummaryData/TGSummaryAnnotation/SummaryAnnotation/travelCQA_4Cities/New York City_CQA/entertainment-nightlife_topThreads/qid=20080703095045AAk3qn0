Tour madison Square garden - it was fun tour ENTITY_Staten_Island ferry -LRB- free ride and has great views of the skyline and the statue of liberty -RRB- ENTITY_Ellis_Island was interesting , but the statue of liberty is closed so there is no point going to it , but ENTITY_ellis island is still cool Times Square Broadway Show -LRB- may I recommend Rent since it is closing , or Wicked . In the ENTITY_Heights is really good as well -RRB- Central Park -LRB- including Strawberry Fields -RRB- The ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art is amazing and the rooftop has such a commanding view of Central park The Museum of Modern Art -LRB- ENTITY_MoMa -RRB- Tour the ENTITY_UN headquarters Walk down 5th avenue . See ENTITY_Tiffany_'s , ENTITY_Saks etc Empire State building -LRB- as tempted as you may be do not go at sunset , you 'll regret it , it takes a good hour to 2 hours just to get to the elevators then another 30 min wait just to get back down . -RRB- Tour of ENTITY_NBC or rockefeller centre . This may sound like a lot for 3 days but I was there for 3 days and did all of this plus a few things that I ca n't recall at the moment . If you have any questions or want some help figuring out how to fit this all into 3 days feel free to go to my profile and contact me I 'll be happy to help . oh and check out hopstop.com GREAT subway directions . Also try newyorkpass.com We got it and it was worth every penny . Saved so much moeny with that thing . Take a few minutes to check out the site

There is a half price ticket window by the Marquis Hotel on W. 46th Street between Broadway & 8th Ave. You can buy tickets the day of . And if you happen to be a student , many theater box offices have tickets for only $ 25 . And also , if it is a hot day you 'll get some nice A/C ! Additionally I reccommend visiting the ENTITY_Metropolitian_Museum_of_Art on 82nd St. and 5th Ave. or the ENTITY_Museum_of_Modern_Art on W. 53rd between 5th & 6th Aves . -LRB- depending on what type of art you prefer -RRB- -- but , yeah , they are two of the best in the world ! Enjoy NYC , it is fantastic !
