You have to get there KILLER early to get a good place to stand and then God help you if you have to go to the bathroom . If you go see it in person , you 'll only go once !

As a native ENTITY_New_Yorker , I go to the rehearsal in front of ENTITY_Macy 's the night before . The acts all hit their mark and do their thing , minus the parade . Or you can go to the park and watch the balloons get filled up .

We bring thermuses with hot chocolate and tea . You should dress warmly . If we start out too late , then we also bring a step ladder so that we can see over the people in the front rows . I agree that it 's great to see it in person once or 2x , but then it 's even better to watch it on the tv while cooking Thanksgiving meal .
