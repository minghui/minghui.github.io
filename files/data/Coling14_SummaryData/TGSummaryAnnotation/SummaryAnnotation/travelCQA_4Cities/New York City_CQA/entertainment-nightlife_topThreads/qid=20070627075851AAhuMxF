Also , Cosmic Diner and ENTITY_Carmine 's are excellent . Tickets to shows : My personal favourite show is Rent , but it really depends on what you 're into . Some good , light shows are Spamalot , 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee , and Legally Blonde . Classic musicals like A Chorus Line , ENTITY_Les_Mis , and Phantom are also good . Then there 's Avenue Q , which is hilarious , if you do n't mind `` puppet nudity . '' It 's basically Sesame Street going through a mid-life crisis :-RRB- . Some popular shows that are more difficult to get tickets to -LRB- even if you rush or lotto -RRB- are ENTITY_Jersey_Boys , Spring Awakening , and Wicked . For cheap tickets to shows , check out the links below , or try TKTS . Times Square is very close to excellent shopping . It 's within walking distance of 5th Ave. , as well as the Herald Square area .
