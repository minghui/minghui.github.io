Is ENTITY_New_York on new years overrated ? Should I go for New Years and pay extra money or go sometime else during the year ? I just want to know if ENTITY_New_Yorkers think the whole ball dropping thing in Time Square is a joke or is it really worth going . I want to go to NY anyway , but I kind of have a feeling New Years is a tourist occasion .

I think of that whole Times Square ball dropping New Year 's Eve thing as the most touristy thing there is . Go in the Springtime -LRB- April is a nice month to visit NYC . -RRB- And get out and WALK a lot ! That 's the best way to see NYC . And do n't just go to the touristy sites , but walk the streets and see the people and what it 's really like here . That 's the best thing to do in NYC ! Oh , I just wanted to add to gcgofer that Broadway is certainly NOT `` closed due to the strike '' ! The strike ended a couple of weeks ago . I saw a Broadway play this past Saturday -LRB- ENTITY_Tom_Stoppard 's Rock and Roll , about the Velvet Revolution in ENTITY_Czechoslovakia - NOT a musical . -RRB- I 'd had tickets during the strike , but exchanged them for this past weekend .

You 've gotten mixed reviews on the whole Times Square experience , and here 's why : Yes , it 's a zoo -- there 's zillions of people crammed into one tiny little spot , which can be crazy . On the other hand , there 's a reason why so many people come : It 's a blast !! Definitely not for everyone , it 's an experience you should have at least once in your life . I did it a number of years ago , and I have no regrets . Will I do it again ? Probably when the occasion arises to take an out-of-towner for their first time . So , if you can find a place to stay , by all means go . If not , the spring is a lovely time to visit , and you can stroll around Times Square in a more leisurely fashion ... and choose your hotel for NEXT New Year 's Eve ! Happy Travels , and Happy New Year ! ENTITY_Kango_Traveler

We predict a very cold winter , so it would be freezing that night . But that does n't mean you ca n't do other things here during the new year season . Shops , restaurants , a lot of local holiday markets , free ice skating in ENTITY_Bryant park on 42nd street . If you are into the holiday celebration , it would be great to come now . If you are more into sightseeing , spring or summer is better . in the summer , there 's also a lot of free concerts in the parks .

qid=20071214140352AAZrKwY_answer_5	2	qid=20071214140352AAZrKwY	2007-12-14 22:21:59 +0000	answer	 Its hard to say this year . Do you want to stay and do anything else in NYC ? Broadway is closed due to the strike . I have friends that have been there twice and say it is the biggest party around . You have to get there early in order to be close to the action . There are tons of restaurants and bars open all around the times square area , and every place has its tvs turned on to the local action . As to where to stay , you do n't have to stay in NYC . Their transit system is great , you can be 30 miles out of NYC within an hour of an event like new years . Its up to you , if you like the parties , the lights , the big town ... go for it . If you plan on seeing NYC and play tourist you may want to wait a year .

You do n't have to be in Times Square to see the ball drop while getting cozy with 3 million strangers . There are a lot of things to see during the Holidays in NYC . No place celebrates like ENTITY_NYC .
