Even though no major incidents have happened at the park as of late , you do n't take ANY chances whatsoever . The ONLY part of the park that is okay is at Tavern On The Green , because it is a restaurant that is right off ENTITY_Central_Park_West and W. 66th Street . Generally speaking on the horses you are safe but walking around ... you take a BIG risk .

If you need to , try to walk only on the running tracks because you will often see people running , jogging , and walking their dogs . Avoid the dark areas where there 're only trees . Although there were some events happened in the past , I find Central Park relatively safe at night , however you should always be careful , and definitely do n't walk with your i-pod at night so you wo n't hear if someone approaches you . Now , around the park like Fifth Avenue and Central Park West , you should not be worried at all , but again you never know when something can happen . There are cabs and people walking pretty much all the time , otherwise it gets less people after midnight . During the weekend is pretty much the same on those two Avenues because people do n't hang out there unless they live around there .

There is shakespear in the park at night in the summers , as well as various concerts and all are well lit , very crowded , and very safe . It is much safer than it was a few years back , but I would n't wander alone . If this is your only chance to see the park , I would go to the corner of 59th and 5th where all the horse and buggies and see the park at night that way .

Central Park is HUGE and it 's VERY easy to get lost during the DAY . There are always going to be people that are in the park at night for unsavory reasons and there is no reason for YOU to be in the park after dark unless you 're looking to get into serious trouble . Be smarter than that , do n't put yourself in harm 's way . It 's the only part of ENTITY_Manhattan that I want nothing to do with once it gets dark

Along the edges of the park , for example 5th Ave and 60th street are fine since its so touristy , but its not worth venturing into the park . If you end up needing help , no one will be around .

Bottom line is that the Park is a large place and rather secluded after dark . You would be OK in the 59th St area and going to the Skating rink . You may even be OK in lots of other sections , but why tempt fate .
