I live in a working class town in north-east ENTITY_England and I went to ENTITY_New_York_City in 2004 when I was 12 . My grandparents took me and it was amazing . I hope I get a chance to go back one day and maybe even live there .

Although living in a big crowded city can also be overwhelming . A big city can be great to visit , but when you actualy live in one for a length of time , wide open spaces can seem very appealing . Like they always so , the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence . .

Great restaurants of every ethnic and national group , great theater , every sport -LRB- yes , you can even see teams play rugby and cricket here if you insist -RRB- . There are spots here where if you hang around just about every famous person you ever heard of will walk by . So many movies and televsion shows use the city for a backdrop that you can even watch this being done . I 've been to northeast ENTITY_England -- ENTITY_Beverley and ENTITY_York .

I 'm a friendly type , so I know lots of people in my neighborhood and ca n't walk down my block without running into people I know and saying `` hi . '' I know the proprietors of the shops in the nabe and they know me . Of course , people can avoid their neighbors , be anonymous and be left alone if that 's desired . But there 's lots of neighborliness . And there 's a food boutique -LRB- it calls itself a supermarket -RRB- on the corner . If needed , I can run out , buy an ingredient and be back in my kitchen within 10 mins . And I can either walk or take a bus or subway nearly everywhere . No need for a car . And within a few minutes walk , there 's the river to walk along or Central Park which is gorgeous every season of the year . And there are Museums and theatre ... any kind of cultural event you would want . I love ENTITY_Manhattan .
