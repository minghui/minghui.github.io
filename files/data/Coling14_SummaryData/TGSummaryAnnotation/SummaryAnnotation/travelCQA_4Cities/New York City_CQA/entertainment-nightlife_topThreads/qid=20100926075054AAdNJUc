This save me from boiling it on the stove and wasting the gas or buying water and filters . A little trick I learned growing up in the Islands . We always get hit with a storm between June and November and it affects our drinking water and one reason I was glad to move to the ENTITY_USA . As for the bottled water , I only buy those for guest coming over so they have a choice between tap and bottled . It is usually the store brand or whatever goes on sale . I hope that helps .
