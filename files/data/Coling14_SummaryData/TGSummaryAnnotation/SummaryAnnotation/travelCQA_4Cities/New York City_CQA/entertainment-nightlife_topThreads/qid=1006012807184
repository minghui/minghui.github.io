However , if you have comfortable shoes -LRB- or hop on the subway/bus frequently - Get a 1 day unlimited travel metrocard for $ 7 -RRB- , you can do a lot : Start by walking west on 42nd Street to 7th Avenue/Broadway . Turn North and walk through the ENTITY_Times_Square_Area . When you get to 49th Street , walk West again to 6th Avenue and check out ENTITY_Radio_City_Music_Hall . Walk West one more avenue to 5th Avenue and check out ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center and ENTITY_St._Patrick 's Cathedral . Depending on your interests , you can either decide to walk North on 5th Avenue , window shop at the expensive stores , and then hit Central Park at 59th Street first , or/afterwards , head down 5th Avenue to 34th Street and the Empire State Building . After that , you can take the subway to ENTITY_Lower_Manhattan and check out the World Trade Center Site . Depending on the time and if you are hungry , afterwards you can travel a bit north and east and enjoy a meal in ENTITY_Chinatown . Take the subway back to 42nd Street and your worldwind tour of NYC is complete !

The best food you can find would be in ENTITY_Little_Italy . Try going into a pizza place that is n't too touristy or out in the open and go to a family owned place . They have the best food and atmospheres ! Walk the streets as much as you can and have fun !
