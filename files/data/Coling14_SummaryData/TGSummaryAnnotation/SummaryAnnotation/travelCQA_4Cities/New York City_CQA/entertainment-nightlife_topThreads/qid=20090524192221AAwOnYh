My 17 year old daughter and I are going to NYC for a few days in June . What , besides Broadway shows , are some things we can do in the evenings ? Comedy clubs ? Live music places that are appropriate for both a teen and a mom ? Any other suggestions ? Only looking for evening entertainment options , we have the days covered .

EDIT : i just thought of this : how about taking in a baseball game ? you can see either the ENTITY_Yankees or the ENTITY_Mets , whoever 's here when you 're in town ...

In the summer , you can find free concerts all over the city outdoors , free movies along the piers and other places , dancing outside at ENTITY_Lincoln_Square or in ENTITY_Riverside_Park_etc. . Yes , there are comedy clubs , and of course a ENTITY_Mets or ENTITY_Yankee 's game , but even more fun would be to take the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bound_Q train to the last stop ENTITY_Stillwell_Avenue in ENTITY_Coney_Island , get nathan 's ENTITY_Franks and Fries and go see a ENTITY_Brooklyn_Cyclones baseball game . You can ride the amazing Cyclone Rollercoaster -LRB- 8 dollars a ride , discounted if you stay on to ride again -RRB- and walk the boardwalk into ENTITY_Brighton_Beach for ENTITY_Russian_Food . You can do this in the day but at night it is much more fun . .

Personally , when I went to ENTITY_New_York , I really enjoyed checking out all of the nice purses they had for sale . A few other things that you might like to try out are ENTITY_Madame_Tussards_Wax_Museam -LRB- this was really cool when I went , I just wish I had more time to go -RRB- , Top Of ENTITY_The_Rock -LRB- you basically go up to this really high building & get to see all of ENTITY_New_York from up there , it 's cold though -RRB- , & maybe even the ENTITY_Jeckel_&_Hyde shop , I 've never been there but it looked very interesting when I passed it on my bus . You could go out to eat at this really cool restaurant called Mars 2112 I believe , it 's decked out to look all solar system like with the waitor 's & waitresses dressed up as aliens . It might sound a little childish , but I thougt it was really cool when I went , the food was a little expensive though , but then again , most things are in ENTITY_New_York .
