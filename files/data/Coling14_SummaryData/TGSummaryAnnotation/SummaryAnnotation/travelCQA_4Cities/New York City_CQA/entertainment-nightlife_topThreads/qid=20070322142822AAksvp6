Hotels in NYC -LRB- ENTITY_Manhattan -RRB- are expensive . You should look for motels or hostels or the hotels out of ENTITY_Manhattan , those are cheaper . Never reserve directly through hotel , always look online to get the best deal .

It is great in the summer , but there are way to many tourists and it is the most expensive . The winter is cheaper , but it is a horrible time to go . It is freezing and it is really windy and there arent as many places to go see and you wont be able to enjoy ENTITY_New_York . The spring time would be great because its not to hot and its not that cold and there arent as many tourists as in the summer but there will be alot . There will always be alot of tourists whenever you go to ENTITY_New_York . As for cheap , ENTITY_New_York is never cheap . The cheapest it gets though is in the winter , but it will probably be best to go in the spring or fall .

I loved every minute of it . I would do anything to go back there ! My Bf and I stayed in the Dream Hotel which is situated on Broadway and it 's approx 10 min walking distance to Central Park and the shopping centres . The people are lovely and the city is beautiful , especially on a sunday morning in CP . We paid Â£950 for flights -LRB- with Virgin -RRB- and our accomodation which was 5days and 4 nights . I 'd recommend that you go ... you will love it !

Ca n't remember which hotel I stayed in but there are plenty and that is definitely the best time of year to go .
