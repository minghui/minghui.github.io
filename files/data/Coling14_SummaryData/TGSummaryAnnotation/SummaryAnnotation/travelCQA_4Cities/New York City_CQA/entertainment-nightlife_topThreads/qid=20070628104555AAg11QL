It can get really cold here in the winter with temps at times in the low teens ... and the summer can be oppressively hot and humid -LRB- as it is today -RRB- during the months of July and August . As for what to do ... that depends on your interests . We have plenty of museums ... Metropolitan Museum of Art , ENTITY_American_Museum_of_Natural_History , ENTITY_Guggenheim , ENTITY_MoMA , to name a few . You can also take the ENTITY_Circle_Line boat tour of ENTITY_Manhattan where you can see all the major landmarks including a great view of the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty . Of course , there 's also plenty of shopping if you 're here for goods . Hope this helps to get you started ! Happy travels !
