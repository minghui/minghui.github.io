It 's a little pricey , but you can see all of downtown ENTITY_Manhatten , it 's awesome at night ! Also , take cabs , do not drive and do not take private cars , yellow taxi 's are the cheapest unless you hit the subway or the bus .

There is absolutely nothing to see at Ground Zero - it 's just a big hole in the ground . Unless you want to buy cheap , fake handbags , forget ENTITY_China_Town . It 's really crowded and stinky and there is n't much to do . In December , I would recommend skating at Wollman Rink in Central Park - it can get very busy , so you must arrive early but the scenery is beautiful . As an alternative , you can go ice skating at ENTITY_Chelsea Piers . The ENTITY_American_Museum_of_Natural_History is wonderful - it usually has a live butterfly vivarium during the wintertime -LRB- they actual fly and land on you -RRB- ! It has a wonderful cafeteria in the basement so you could spend hours inside in the warm and have a great time . Grand Central Terminal is also beautiful . The christmas markets inside the terminal are open in December . There are also christmas markets in Union Square and ENTITY_Bryant_Park . Sometimes , ENTITY_Bryant_Park has free ice skating in the winter . Of course , I would also remember catching a Broadway show . You can order online using ticketmaster or telecharge . There is also a discount ticket place in Times Square called TKTS .

Garden , Littly ENTITY_Italy , ENTITY_East_Village along st. marks place is great too . . if you wan na see a show hit up the TKTS booth in times square for discount broadway tickets what not to see ... ground zero is over rated , they didnt even start rebuilding yet . ENTITY_China town smells bad and is filled with irritating peddlers , and avoid times square , it is over crowded and every thing there is over priced . Avoid that area unless you are seeing a show .
