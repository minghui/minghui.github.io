The ENTITY_New_York_Times always has huge ads about what 's on -- I recommend picking a Sunday NYT up at you newstand -LRB- I can get the paper here in the ENTITY_South , so they probably distribute all over the country -RRB- . I 've always wanted to see the Metropolitan Museum of Art . It 's huge -- you could spend a whole day or more there ! But really , just walking around is a lot of fun ! Central Park has some cool statues and fountains and stuff in it , and there 's always things happening . You should n't miss Central Park .
