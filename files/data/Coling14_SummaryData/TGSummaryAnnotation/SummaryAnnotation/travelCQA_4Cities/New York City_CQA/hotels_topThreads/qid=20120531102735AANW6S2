I am hoping to fly in and walk and use the subway while I am there , so I am looking for a hotel that is near the subway and in a safe area . I 'm not looking for anything fancy , just clean . I would like to spend around $ 120 a night if possible . I found a Comfort Suites on Maurice Avenue , but I was n't sure if there was a subway that was close by .

Very classy , clean and although I do n't remember how much I paid -LRB- it was a few years ago -RRB- . Also saw ENTITY_Ashton_Kutcher and ENTITY_Demi_Moore there -LRB- When they were still together obviously -RRB- Walking distance from almost everything .

I 've read over at ENTITY_TripAdvisor.com that it 's a good idea to stay over in ENTITY_Long_Island_City and take the subway into ENTITY_Manhattan , as it 's pretty close by , evidently . Unless you want to spend a lot of time `` commuting '' , you do n't want to stay outside of ENTITY_Manhattan , or very far , at least . I suggest you go over to ENTITY_TripAdvisor and look at their hotel list and guest comments , as well as the forum for ENTITY_NYC . We recently stayed near Times Square , in a room with a full kitchen -LSB- although we did n't really get to use it ! -RSB- for about $ 300 per night and felt that was a pretty good deal .

You 'd have to take the bus into the city which only drops you off in the city on 125th street in the ghetto bronx , then you 'd have to take a subway to get downtown which will take an additional 30 minutes . If you take a taxi into the city it will be at least $ 30 to get to 125th street . . it 's not worth it . You will pay just as much money coming and going from ENTITY_LGA than if you just got a hotel room in the city . You are better off looking around ENTITY_Astoria or ENTITY_Long_Island_City Try this place : It 's right next to the 7 subway line and it 's only a couple stops on the subway into the city - the 7 line takes you directly into Grand Central , then ENTITY_Bryant_Park , then Times Square . It 's ideal . Good luck . ps . this hotel is only $ 140 a night with free breakfast and you are 15 minutes from the heart of the city .
