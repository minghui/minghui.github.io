My girlfriend and I are traveling to ENTITY_New_York_City in may and are a looking for a deal in ENTITY_Manhattan . There seems to be a handful of decent rooms available that are under $ 200 , but many of them have shared bathrooms . Having never stayed at such a hotel I am obviously a little apprehensive about this , so if you 've stayed at a shared bathroom hotel what are they like in general ?

So , think of living with ten people -LRB- two to a room -RRB- and sharing a bathroom . Sometimes , though , they have stalls instead of just a single . So , be sure to call and ask questions .

There 's also a small , quite nice European-type hotel in ENTITY_San_Francisco that I tend to stay at , that has this arrangement . No problem , it 's just that the bathrooms are down the hall , like in a college dorm .

All the things , other people have siad would apply , the hotel is in a good neighborhood , conveniently located , clean -- but do n't expect a big room or a view of anything expect the building next door .

Some arent horrid , but I dont like them , especially a pain if you 've got plans and 10 otheres are in line ahead of you . Even worse when a toilet gets broken . Nasty .

You take your stuff down the hall to the bathroom and if it 's not in use , you get to use it , pack your stuff back out and go back to your room . That 's how they did it in the old days ... not all hotels had separate baths for each room ... and a lot of the hotels in places like ENTITY_New_York are that old ...

You do n't have other people coming in whilst you are in there . It simply means the bathroom is shared by several guests . It is fine and you have nothing to worry about other people seeing you . ENTITY_New_York is a beautiful city and you will love it . I lived there for several years and enjoyed every minute . It is a very safe city and most of the people are so friendly . Have a great time you will never forget it .
