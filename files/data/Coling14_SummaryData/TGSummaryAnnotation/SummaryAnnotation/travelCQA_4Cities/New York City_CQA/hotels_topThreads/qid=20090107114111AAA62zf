Get a subway map -LRB- invaluable since driving in the city is a nightmare and ridiculously expensive to park -RRB- , a good pair of comfortable shoes , and a camera . Start with ENTITY_Madison Square/Penn Station , and from there to the immediate east -LRB- 16th St -RRB- is the Empire State Building , just across from ENTITY_Penn_Station is the original ENTITY_Macys , a little north along Broadway and you come to Central Park , the Central Park Zoo , and along the path you come to the ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History . And that 's just for the center of the ENTITY_City . Staying there will be expensive . If you can , stay across the river in ENTITY_New_Jersey , drive to a PATH -LRB- jersey 's subway -RRB- station , take the PATH to ENTITY_Penn , and travel .

But try to get one on the edge of TS , not right in the heart of it . In the center of TS it can be very loud , even on a very high floor . My GF 's mother just came to visit us and stayed at the ENTITY_Sheraton_New_York . Link here : http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/pâ€?It was a reasonable rate and the central location proved to be very convenient . It is close to a lot of major attractions . Room was nice , if on the small side . Not noisy at all . The best part was she had a subway stop just steps from the hotel doors . All in all , I would definitely recommend staying there .
