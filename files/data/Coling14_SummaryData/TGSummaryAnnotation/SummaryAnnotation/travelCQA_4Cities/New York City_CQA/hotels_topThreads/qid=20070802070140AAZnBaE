You can look at all the hotels via Price or location . We stayed at the ENTITY_Radisson_SAS on ENTITY_Lexington and that was reasonable , the rooms were comfortable and everything worked , it was a pretty nice hotel . There are hotels everywhere in NY so do your research as to where they are . On ENTITY_Lexington we were within walking distance of 5th Avenue , Central Park , Chrysler Building , Grand Central Station and the Empire State Building . There was a underground station just round the corner with really easy links to Wall Street . One area I would recommend would be ENTITY_South_Street_Seaport , they have some great shops and Pier 17 has a fantastic restaurant that looks out over the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge . Do n't try to do everything , I 've been twice now and there is still stuff I have n't done . But I would recommend the following : Go up the ENTITY_Empire_State_Blg at night , the views are stunning . Go to the ENTITY_Rockerfeller_Centre and go up to the top , you can see Central Park Go to the Natural History ENTITY_Museam and look at the dinosaur skeletons - you 'll feel like you are in a movie Walk round central park Visit the very small zoo in central park and watch the sea lions ENTITY_Walk to the Flat Iron building Visit Pier 17 and South Street Seaport Eat a hot dog from a street vendor Go to Toys R Us just for the sheer madness of it . Stand in Times Square for 5 minutes and just soak it all in And best of all , just walk and explore .
