My girlfriend and I are planning a trip to ENTITY_New_York . We do not have a huge budget so does anyone know some good hotels to stop in ? Also where is most central to ENTITY_New_York . I have looked at hundreds of hotels and do n't really know which are the best in relation to the centre of ENTITY_New_York . There are also loads of areas like ENTITY_Newark which are confusing me . Any help would be appreciated . Thanks

If you are willing to share a bathroom , try the ENTITY_Gershwin_Hotel - very plain , but very clean and inexpensive http://www.gershwinhotel.com/english/sitâ€?Also , check out The Pod Hotel http://thepodhotel.com/ And the Chelsea Lodge http://www.chelsealodge.com/ When my brother and his family come to ENTITY_New_York , they always stay at the ENTITY_Belvedere - he always negotiates a price less than $ 175 through orbitz , ENTITY_travelocity , ENTITY_priceline , or some such . The Belvedere is spotless , has a great staff , is in the heart of Times Square and every room has a microwave and fridge , so you can save money by bringing back your restaurant leftovers . http://www.belvederehotelnyc.com/ Try to stay in ENTITY_Manhattan - Times Square hotels are generally higher in price than other neighborhoods , but the public transportation in ENTITY_New_York is wonderful - there is a bus or subway every few blocks , they run frequently and they run all night . If you stay in ENTITY_New_Jersey or ENTITY_Queens , you 'll save some money , but you wo n't have the convenience of being able to change your shoes in the middle of the day , shower , go back to your room and rest till dinner , be able to store your packages , etc. - it 's worth paying more money just for the convenience of being in ENTITY_Manhattan . There are some nice small hotels and bed and breakfasts in ENTITY_Chelsea and the Village . Before you decide on any hotel , check Trip Advisor see what the previous guests thought about it and would they stay there again ? http://www.tripadvisor.com/ Have a great time !

You should be able to get a reasonable room there and it 's totally central for anywhere you want to go . ENTITY_manhattan is small enough to walk to all the major places of interest . Hope that helps !

You want to stay in ENTITY_Manhattan , hotel rooms are very small and basic unless you have lots of cash.The ENTITY_Wellington Hotel is ok and the Comfort Inn is just around the corner from ENTITY_Macys . If this is your first trip , use the ENTITY_New_York Sightseeing tour bus which you can book online before you go or when you get there . ITs a good way of seeing th City first time and you hop on hop off where you like . Hope this helps

Try to steer clear of ENTITY_JFK_airport , there are loads of really dodgy hotels and areas round there , ENTITY_Newark is the best airport to fly in and out of .
