They are pretty spendy , but you might find a deal at The Warwick or the ENTITY_Hilton in that area . The only other alternative would be to think about ENTITY_SOHO or Village area and ride the subway to Times Square . That does not take very long and you might save a pile of dough .

The CHEAPEST is the Elk Hotel , IN ENTITY_Manhattan , $ 60 per night , corner of W 42nd St. and 9th Ave. . . but it might not meet your standard of `` decent '' !

Go here - trust me : http://www.hinewyork.org/ I just stayed here for two night earlier this week . It 's exactly like a college dormotory . I was very impressed . It 's a safe , clean and comfortable place to stay . It 's ONE block from a major Subway line -LRB- # 1,2 & 3 -RRB- that takes you to all the main places in ENTITY_Manhattan . -LRB- 5 minutes to Times Square and 6 minutes to Grand Central where you get get to anywhere else -RRB- And it 's 2 blocks from Central Park ! Way easy too get to . It 's 30 dollars a night per person - you CA N'T beat that for ENTITY_Manhattan . TRUST ME ! They provide you clean linens -LRB- including towels -RRB- and housekeeping services daily . The best thing about this place is that they have tons of free tours of the area that they 'll take you on . No hotels will have that ! Also , they have discounted tickets for other attractions . It 's a great place to meet people . I met people from ENTITY_Japan , ENTITY_Ireland , ENTITY_Egypt ... all over the place and of all ages . Familes and young travelers all stay there . They have on-site laundry facilities for free as well as a coffee shop for when hunger strikes as well as a gift shop . The have internet access and a fun little lounge to hang out in and get to know people . I 'm glad I went - you wo n't regret it .
