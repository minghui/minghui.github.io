You can walk from ENTITY_Penn_Station to Times Square , it 's only about 8 blocks straight up 7th Ave. From Times Square you can get to the WTC site by subway by taking the E train downtown to the World Trade Center stop , or you can take the A , C , 2 , or 3 trains downtown to Chambers Street . It 's a 15 minutes subway ride . The heart of ENTITY_Chinatown is Canal Street , a number of subway lines stop along it . It 's not a very far walk from the WTC ; you 'd want to walk up Broadway . -LRB- From the WTC site , walk east on ENTITY_Varrick or ENTITY_Fulton or Barclay until you get to Broadway ; it 's only a block . Turn left on Broadway and you 'll walk past city hall . I think it 's only a 10 or 15 minute walk to Canal Street from there . When you get to Canal , turn right and you 'll be in ENTITY_Chinatown . You can also take the A , C , or E train to Canal Street . But first thing you should do when you get to Penn Station is get a subway map . They 're available for free from kiosks around ENTITY_Penn_Station or the subway booths .

Ground Zero is in lower ENTITY_Manhattan - the financial district . ENTITY_Chinatown is not too far north of that . I 'm sorry , but I can not remember where Penn Station is . It 's somewhere in the middle of all of that . ENTITY_Greenwich_Village is artsy and full of pubs where singers like ENTITY_Bob_Dylan have played . The Empire State Building is up near Central Park -LRB- 60th St. -RRB- The other end of the park -LRB- 110th St. -RRB- is the beginning of ENTITY_Harlem . The blocks in ENTITY_New_York are very big . You might be at 200 Fifth Ave. and think to walk to 800 Fifth Ave. and end up walking several miles . I did this once . Everything in ENTITY_NYC is North/South . The subway runs N/S and stops everywhere that you will need . The subway in ENTITY_Manhattan is safe even though there are a few , different people . There are lots of taxis so some people just wait on the curb and try to hail one . There are lots of cops walking around NYC .
