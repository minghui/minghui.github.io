'' If you 're on a budget , I 'd stay at the New Yorker hotel near ENTITY_Penn_Station . It 's just blocks from Herald Square -LRB- ENTITY_Macy 's -RRB- , Madison Square Garden , and Times Square . Price-wise , you can sometimes get rooms for as little as $ 150 , which is a steal for ENTITY_New_York . For a middle-priced hotel , the ENTITY_Renaissance_Times_Square ca n't be beat . The location is perfect -- smack-dab in the middle of Times Square , puttin you within blocks of Rockefeller Center , Central Park , ENTITY_Carnegie_Hall and ENTITY_Radio_City_Music_Hall . If money is no object , I 'd normally recommend the ENTITY_Pierre ; but it 's undergoing a renovation at the moment . Instead , check out the Sherry-Netherland , which is a ENTITY_New_York institution -LRB- oh , if those walls could talk ! -RRB- . It 's VERY top-of-the-line , and the location is perfect : Directly across the street from ENTITY_Central_Park , it 's also directly in the middle of Fifth Avenue 's best shopping . Enjoy your trip to ENTITY_New_York ! ENTITY_Kango_Traveler

I have stayed at numerous hotels in NY , but would never stay anywhere other than Times Square now . Maybe check out the ENTITY_Novotel - it has great views .

It 's a safe , clean and comfortable place to stay . It 's ONE block from a major Subway line -LRB- # 1,2 & 3 -RRB- that takes you to all the main places in ENTITY_Manhattan . -LRB- 5 minutes to Times Square and 6 minutes to Grand Central where you get get to anywhere else -RRB- And it 's 2 blocks from Central Park ! Way easy too get to . It 's 30 dollars a night per person - you CA N'T beat that for ENTITY_Manhattan . TRUST ME ! They provide you clean linens -LRB- including towels -RRB- and housekeeping services daily . The best thing about this place is that they have tons of free tours of the area that they 'll take you on . No hotels will have that ! Also , they have discounted tickets for other attractions . It 's a great place to meet people . I met people from ENTITY_Japan , ENTITY_Ireland , ENTITY_Egypt ... all over the place and of all ages . Familes and young travelers all stay there . They have on-site laundry facilities for free as well as a coffee shop for when hunger strikes as well as a gift shop . The have internet access and a fun little lounge to hang out in and get to know people . I 'm glad I went - you wo n't regret it .
