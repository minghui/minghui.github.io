When you need views from any hotel , be sure to notify them verbally and in advance . This way , they can try to hold those rooms . If not , when you arrive later at the hotel , you may be : * on the wrong wing of the hotel * too low to see what you need * in front of trees , objects and other building that blocks your view . Enjoy the city .

Its only 2-3 * but it used to be an apartment block and the rooms are huge , i went with my dad and we had a big room with two double beds , a gigantic lounge , a kitchen area , a large hallway with walk in closet , and a bathroom , you could eat at the hotel for breakfast for $ 6 per person -LRB- buffet -RRB- and it is a 2minute walk to central park . Highly recommended . it was not too expensive and the only reason is 2-3 * is because it is semi old fashioned , however i thouraghly enjoyed it .
