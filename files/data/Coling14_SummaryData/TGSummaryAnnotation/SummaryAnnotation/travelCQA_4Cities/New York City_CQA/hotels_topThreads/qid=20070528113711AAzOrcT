We 're going to ENTITY_New_York this summer and are trying to book a hotel . Is W. 35th St a good place to stay ? Also , if we stay in ENTITY_New_Jersey , can you take a subway into ENTITY_New_York ?
qid=20070528113711AAzOrcT_answer_1	1	qid=20070528113711AAzOrcT	2007-05-28 19:42:50 +0000	best_answer	 Most places in ENTITY_New_York are pretty safe . You should n't worry too much about that . If you are worried about valuables , take them with you when you go out . West 35th Street should be a very safe area . This area spans from the Herald Square area -LRB- ENTITY_Macy 's -RRB- to the Fashion District to the Javits Convention Center all the way on the west side . You can find reviews of your hotel on www.tripadvisor.com for an idea of the hotel you are planning to book . If you stay in NJ , you can take the PATH train or ENTITY_NJ_Transit train into ENTITY_Manhattan , depending on where in ENTITY_Jersey you will be . Check with the hotel , but the commute can be quite quick . Just a few train stops . It will range in price . I included some links for you . have a great time .

Areas you do not want to stay in : ENTITY_Manhattan -- West side between 125 and 158 Street , East side above 103 Street ; Lower East side ENTITY_Brooklyn : ENTITY_Brownsville , ENTITY_Bed-Stuy , ENTITY_Fort_Green_Queens : ENTITY_South_Jamaica_Bronx : ENTITY_South_Bronx_Staten_Island , ENTITY_Jersey_Street , ENTITY_Mariners_Harbor , parts of ENTITY_Stapleton_Jersey_City , ENTITY_Hoboken and ENTITY_Newark all sit along the route of the PATH train , a subway costing $ 1.50 per ride and going into two parts of ENTITY_Manhattan , the World Trade Center area and west 33 Street .

Mostly big clothing businesses and small stores in that neighborhood . Quite safe . Not many live there however . If you could get a reasonable priced room on W. 35th , go for it . You are a walking distance from Times Square , Madison Square Garden , and the Jacob Javits Center . As far as parts of NYC you should n't stay in , the parts where there are no ENTITY_Hilton , ENTITY_Ramada , or Holiday Inns .

My husband 's office is on W. 35th Street . It 's right in the middle of the garment district . Not really elegant , but a lot better than it used to be and relatively safe .

The PATH trains are just a few minutes walk away . I know there is a ENTITY_Doubletree_Hotel at ENTITY_Newport . The PATH train , very safe , only crowded at rush hour , -LRB- I think it 's about $ 1.50 -RRB- can get you to the financial district -LRB- World Trade Site , Wall Street , Battery Park -RRB- in about 10 minutes , and midtown -LRB- Herald Square , Madison Square Garden , Empire State Building -RRB- ENTITY_Manhattan in about 20 minutes . The subways are relatively safe . Trying not to look like a tourist will help a great deal . Enjoy !
