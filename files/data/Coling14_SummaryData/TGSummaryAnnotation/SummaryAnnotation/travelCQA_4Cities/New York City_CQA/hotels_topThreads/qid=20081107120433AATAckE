I 'm planning trip to ENTITY_New_York in April 09 , prices since last year have rocketed ! Has anyone been recently and can recommend a good clean hotel which is central to everything or even just a short train ride away . Thank you for sharing your experience .

I dont know if that fits your budget , but I thought it was cheap for ENTITY_Midtown_Manhattan , especially for the quality of the hotel . We booked through the `` Name Your Own Price '' feature on ENTITY_Priceline.com . I would suggest trying all of the discount travel websites , they usually have the best prices . What part of ENTITY_NYC will you be visiting ? If you do n't mind staying in one of the other boroughs , hotels are usually cheaper there than in ENTITY_Manhattan . Edit : I just checked the ENTITY_Paramount website and it looks like they have rooms right now starting at $ 159/night . They are calling it their Winter Special , but they seem to keep their prices decent year round . I included the website below if you are interested . The rooms are small -LRB- typical in NYC -RRB- , but this hotel is VERY clean and classy . The staff was friendly when we went , there is a bar/lounge on the first floor of the hotel , and it is a few blocks from the heart of Times Square . Also , it is right near a great pizza restaurant called ENTITY_Patzeria and close to ENTITY_Dean and ENTITY_DeLuca 's which is amazing for breakfast !

It has shared bathrooms but that should not put you off , they also do n't o meals but the was a great diner around the corner on the way to the subway station which was really good value
