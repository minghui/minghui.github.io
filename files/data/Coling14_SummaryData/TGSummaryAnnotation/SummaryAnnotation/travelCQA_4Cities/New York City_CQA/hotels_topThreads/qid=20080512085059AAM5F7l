I want it to be as close to the city as possible , but I do n't want it to be in a bad neighborhood . Any recommendations ?

I think its about $ 123 a night . Its a 20 minute -LRB- and four dollar -RRB- train ride to ENTITY_NYC_Penn_Station right smack dab in the center of ENTITY_Manhattan . The ENTITY_Newark_Penn_Station_Hilton is connected to the train station by a sky bridge . A quick walk from your hotel room and you 're 20 minutes away from the city . A comparable room in ENTITY_Manhattan is $ 300 - $ 400 a night . Take a 20 minute train and save a fortune . If you do n't want to do that the next best place is the ENTITY_Milford_Plaza in Times Square . The rooms are EXTREMELY small but are clean and have bathrooms and you can get deals that fit your budget .

There are cheap hotels , and there respectable hotels , but in ENTITY_NYC cheap and nice never go hand in hand . I can give you some options . . Fitzpatrick Grand Central , Millenimum Broadway , ENTITY_Raddisson_Martinuqe , The Helmsely , The Roosevelt . These are all some decent hotels that occasionaly have good rates . I doubt they will ever be less then 175 though . But anything less then 175 is a dump in the city .
