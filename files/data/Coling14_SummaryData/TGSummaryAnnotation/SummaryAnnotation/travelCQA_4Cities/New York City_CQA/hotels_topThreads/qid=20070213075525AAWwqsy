I 'm coming from ENTITY_Detroit and was wondering what would be the best place to stay the night near the stadium . Should I stay in ENTITY_N.J. or go north toward ENTITY_White_Plains ? Then , is the public transportation reliable in that area so I can get the game and any other site in ENTITY_N.Y. ?

The 4 train -LRB- ENTITY_Lexington ave. subway -RRB- , although it will be crowded on a game night , can get you to and from the game in about 20mins -LRB- for $ 2 each way -RRB- if you stay in midtown/on the east side -LRB- east of Park ave. -RRB- . Staying in NJ or ENTITY_Westchester will most likely make the commute to and from much longer and more expensive .

The D and 4-trains both stop there , and it 's just a short ride -LRB- 15 minutes or so -RRB- from ENTITY_Midtown . The subway runs fairly frequently all night long , so you 'll have no problem getting to or from the stadium , no matter where you stay . The cheapest options are generally in ENTITY_Queens or ENTITY_New_Jersey . If you 're staying in ENTITY_Queens , make sure there 's a subway stop nearby . If there is , it will be easy to get to and from anywhere you want to go . I 've stayed at the Comfort Inn -- ENTITY_Briarwood , which is just a couple of blocks from two different subway stations . There are lots of other chains in ENTITY_Jamaica , ENTITY_Flushing , and ENTITY_Long_Island_City that are all quite convenient to the subway . In ENTITY_New_Jersey , you 'll want to make sure you 're near an ENTITY_NJ_Transit train station . There are tons of these all over northern ENTITY_New_Jersey , but many of the hotels are n't really all that convenient to them . If you are near a train station , you can count on trains running hourly during the day and every 2 -3 hours until the wee hours . The same goes of ENTITY_White_Plains , where you 'll want to make sure you 're near a ENTITY_Metro_North commuter train station .

ENTITY_Metro_Park has a ENTITY_Hilton within walking distance to the station , and theres a Sheraton about a mile and a half away that I believe offers free shuttle service to the station . For $ 12.50 round trip and about a 40 minute train ride your in ENTITY_NY_Penn. . Walk across across the street and one block down , and pick up the uptown D train -LRB- one way trip = $ 2.00 -RRB- , to the 161st and River Avenue stop , which usually takes about 15 minutes , and your at Yankee Stadium . Enjoy the game !
