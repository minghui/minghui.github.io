From inside ENTITY_Penn_Station , follow the signs to the uptown # 1 , # 2 , or # 3 subway trains , and go one station to West 42nd Street/Times Square . Walk about two minutes and you should get to your address . If you have about 20 minutes and the weather is nice , it 's also an easy walk from ENTITY_Penn Station through the Garment District .

ENTITY_Penn_Station occupies the space between 31st and 33rd Streets , and 7th and 8th Avenues . Easy walk at all times , though if it 's raining hard and if the extra $ 2.25 is worth it to you , you can take any uptown 1/2/3 train from ENTITY_Penn_Station and get off at the next stop , 42nd Street/Times Square . But I 'd just walk it under almost any circumstances .

Take the uptown -LRB- northbound -RRB- # 1 , 2 or 3 subway line from ENTITY_Penn_Station to Times Square . Once you get to Time Square , exit the subway and walk 2 blocks north along 7th Avenue from the subway station to the 44th Street . Turn left and walk a half block west to your final destination . Good luck ENTITY_Native_New_Yorker
