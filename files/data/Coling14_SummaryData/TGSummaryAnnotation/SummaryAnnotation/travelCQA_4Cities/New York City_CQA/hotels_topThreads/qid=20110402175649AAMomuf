ENTITY_Royal_Park_Hotel_&_Hostel is in the ENTITY_Upper_West_Side http://tinyurl.com/3frgojq Not Times Square , but very good location nevertheless and the hotel has OK reviews for price and location -LRB- not raving , but given the location and the price , not horrible either -RRB- . Hotel 91 is in the ENTITY_Lower_East_Side . Again , not in Times Square , but still in ENTITY_Manhattan . http://tinyurl.com/4x4qg88 Still in ENTITY_Manhattan you have the 309 http://tinyurl.com/3ccbqao Finally , The Travel Inn is about 15 minutes WALK from ENTITY_Times_Square http://tinyurl.com/3j34yjh This might also help : ENTITY_Best_NYC_Hotels on a Tight Budget http://polistraveladvices.blogspot.com/2â€?Times Square Budget Accommodation http://tinyurl.com/3ojttl5 More Hotels near Times Square , sorted by price http://tinyurl.com/3gafz3y

My sister now living in ENTITY_California lived in ENTITY_Greenwich_Village for like 10 years and my brother-in-law is from ENTITY_Long_Island . When both of our famillies visit NYC , we find staying in ENTITY_New_Jersey -LRB- like ENTITY_Jersey_City , Secausus -RRB- and riding ENTITY_NI_Transit and Path trains into NYC which overall is more Economical $ $ . Best website we use and recommend to plan `` lodging '' is ENTITY_TripAdvisor as feedback and ratings are honest . Suites with kitchens and at least refrigerator do wonders to reduce meal costs but equally more for our family is free continental breakfast , WiFi connection -LRB- we bring Notebook PCs , iPad and iPod Touches -RRB- swimming pool depending on season and sometimes would you believe free parking ? bec hotel guests are billed daily for parking in places like ENTITY_NYC , ENTITY_Toronto , and at the ocean -LRB- one vehicle per room -RRB- etc. . Hope the Above Info Helps !
