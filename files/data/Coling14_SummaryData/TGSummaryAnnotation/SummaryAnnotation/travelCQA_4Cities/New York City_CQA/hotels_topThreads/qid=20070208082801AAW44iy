On both the east and west sides , the wealthy live close to Central Park so they could see the park from their window . On the east side , Fifth Avenue , you have 14-room apartments worth more than $ 20 million dollars . On the West side , Central Park West , same story , including ENTITY_Mick_Jaeggar of Rolling Stone fame who lives in the 70s street . Also plenty of celebrities on the ENTITY_East_Side , ENTITY_Barbara_Walters lives there . Way too many celebrities to mention that live in apartments overlooking ENTITY_Central_Park . On the East side , you have more museums including the Met on Fifth Avenue , the Guggheimer , the ENTITY_Whitney , and so on . On the ENTITY_West_Side , you have the Natural Museum of History on Central Park West , plus ENTITY_John_Lennon 's ENTITY_Strawberry_Fields .

However , there are a lot of wealthy `` urban artist '' type people in ENTITY_SoHo , ENTITY_TriBeCa , and the meat-packing district . It depends on if you 're talking wealthy-trendy or wealthy-snooty . As far as hotspots go , there is literally a hot new restaurant opening somewhere in ENTITY_Manhattan every night , and I 'm sure you 've heard of all the traditional sights to see , such as ENTITY_MoMA , the Met , etc. . My personal favorite hangout in NY is Barcode , which is kind of like an uber-trendy ENTITY_Dave and ENTITY_Buster 's type club with arcade games in it . It 's right next to the W hotel , but I forget what street it 's on .

I 've been in a few `` multi - million dollar '' apartments in this area . It is very disapponting to see that they pay twenty times what someone in ENTITY_Des_Moines who works as a garbage collector does .

Some very wealthy New Yorkers select a variety of neighborhoods based on preferences . Along Fifth Avenue north of 59th Street , Park Avenue and Central Park West are three prominent areas . However , many choose the ENTITY_Soho and ENTITY_Tribeca areas downtown today . I know a self-made billionaire -LRB- seriously -RRB- who rebuilt a mansion in ENTITY_Brooklyn_Heights . He has a driver to ferry him to his ENTITY_Manhattan offices and to his biz jet at ENTITY_Teterboro_Airport -LRB- NJ -RRB- .
