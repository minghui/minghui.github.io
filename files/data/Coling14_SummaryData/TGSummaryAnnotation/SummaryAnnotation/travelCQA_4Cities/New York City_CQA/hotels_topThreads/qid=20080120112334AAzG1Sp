Hotels are aplenty , so as long a its not infested with vermin almost any Will be fine . . you 'll spend nearly all your time out anyway ... somewhere near Central Park will probably be best . . Try the Plaza if you can afford it , its mega expensive ... he park is huge and fantastic any time of year ... I 've been over about 12-13 times and always find something different to do . . you will love it i promise

The Belvedere Hotel 48th Street , 8th Ave is 5 mins from Times Square , 7 Mins from Central Park , 5 Mins From Broadway And 2 Blocks From The Rockefeller Center . http://www.belvederehotelnyc.com/ Rooms are a good size for ENTITY_NY and close to all the attractions so that you do n't have to walk for miles . It may seem as it 's so close to all the attractions it will be nosiy but it is n't ! It 's really quiet ! If you do need to travel go by the subway as it is much cheaper than a taxi . Have a good time !

It was great and my fave trip so far . Good for families !
