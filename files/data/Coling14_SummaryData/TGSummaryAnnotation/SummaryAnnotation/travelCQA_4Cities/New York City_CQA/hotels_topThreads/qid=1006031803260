qid=1006031803260_answer_1	1	qid=1006031803260	2006-03-18 16:12:30 +0000	best_answer	 First , this site has links to some good information on hotels : http://www.newyorkology.com/archives/hotâ€?For weekend stays , we tend to go to the financial district . They cut their rates a lot on the weekends because their business customers clear out . We used to stay at the Mariott at the ENTITY_World_Trade_Center , until some bozos dropped a couple of buildings on it . Now we go to the ENTITY_Wall_Street area . If you get an unlimited ride subway card , and are near a good subway stop , it does n't matter much where you stay . You are going to be out around town all day , so your hotel room is just a place to sleep , right ?

Most of the others are either unbelievably expensive or really disgusting . Also , you 'll want to stay somewhere between 40-somethingth and 96th streets . The ENTITY_Upper_East_Side is probably the most expensive area . If you have any other questions realted to the trip , feel free to e-mail me at humphrey09@gmail.com
