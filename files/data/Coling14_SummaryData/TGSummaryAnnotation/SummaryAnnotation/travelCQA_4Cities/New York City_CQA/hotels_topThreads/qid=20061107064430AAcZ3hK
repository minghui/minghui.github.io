ENTITY_New_York is expensive , particularly as you get closer to the city and ENTITY_Manhattan . You 'll get hostels and shared accomodation of some sort for £20 - £50 . You 're looking at £70 upwards for your own room and bathroom in a hotel .

Although if there are a few of you a hostel would let you rent a whole dorm or room to yourselves and many hostels these days do have single or twin rooms too . http://www.statravel.co.uk they often have special offers , 3 nights for the price of 2 and stuff like that . http://www.laterooms.co.uk Great for picking up left over hotel rooms if there are any If you want to know if a place you 're thinking of is any good or might be a craphole , check out http://www.tripadvisor.com for reviews of hotels from other travellers . Have a great time !

qid=20061107064430AAcZ3hK_answer_10	2	qid=20061107064430AAcZ3hK	2006-11-07 14:53:37 +0000	answer	 The hotels ARE expensive in NYC , but if you look hard you can find something around $ 100 with a shared bathroom . If you plan to stay awhile , you might check craigslist for a sublet or someone who is looking to rent out their apartment while they 're out of town . I hope you find something so you can enjoy your trip to NY , the greatest city in the world !
