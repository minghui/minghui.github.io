I have never stayed at the Union Square Inn , but I walk by it everyday . It appears to be nice and I read about in ENTITY_NY_Magazine as an affordable hotel . The people that come in and out seem to be mostly Europeans , clean and `` normal '' . The rooms will run you anywhere from $ 79 a night if you share a bath to $ 169 a night for the most expensive room . They have quite a few prices in between , check the site below . It is a safe neighborhood , centrally located in ENTITY_Manhattan and very close to the Union Square subway station where you can catch the 4 train right on up to 161st Street Yankee stadium . Final year in the stadium . Go ENTITY_Yanks ! http://www.nyinns.com/union.html . .

How ever , you asked for moderately prices hotels in ENTITY_NYC . Unfortunately they do n't exist anymore , the minimum rate for a room in midtown ENTITY_Manhattan is usually around $ 200 per night . You may find rooms for less in either ENTITY_Queens or ENTITY_Brooklyn but the location is not as good .

My Uncle works in managment at the hotel so we get to go their every summer to stay . The place is amazing . It has numerous resturants and shops inside . They even have a beyond amazing all glass fitness studio which I do believe is award winning . The hotel is most definetly the best location seeming as it is right square in the middle of Times Square . The hotel may be a little pricier but you will save money on cabs and subways because there are so many wonderful things within walking distance from the Marquee including Broadway , Toys R ENTITY_US , ENTITY_Hard_Rock , and Good Morning America . Hope I could help !

If you want best location , anywhere in Midtown near 7th Ave. or ENTITY_Lexington_Ave. or Broadway will mostly likely be near a subway station that will allow you to get anywhere in the city . As for price , the average price of a hotel room in ENTITY_New_York_City is now over $ 300 per night . That 's an average , so it 's going to include places in ENTITY_Queens and ENTITY_Staten_Island and the less desirable locations -LRB- like places where prostitutes frequent -RRB- . If you want a decent hotel in ENTITY_Manhattan , where you wo n't fear for your children , expect to start at $ 400 -LRB- unless you 're going in January or February when the rates are a little less -RRB- .

There is a Days Inn and the hotel 's van will take you to Grand Central Station . From there you can pretty much see everything in NYC . Take the subway to all of your locations - it is very easy to use .

It is on the corner of 53rd and 7th in ENTITY_Midtown , just north of ENTITY_Times_Square , and this 4 star hotel is available at only $ 179/night on ENTITY_Orbitz !!!

You do n't want to stay in a hotel in the ENTITY_Bronx where the stadium is ... it 's too bad of an area and it is near nothing ...
