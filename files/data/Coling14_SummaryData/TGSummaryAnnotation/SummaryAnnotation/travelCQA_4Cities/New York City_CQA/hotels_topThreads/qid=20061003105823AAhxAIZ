Close to Times SQ. , Broadway and Central Park is the ENTITY_Wellington , it 's decent enough and competitively priced for the area . It 's just a block from ENTITY_Carnegie_Hall . Once you decide on where you are going to stay , call the concierge desk of the hotel and have him schedule a private van or towncar service for you from ENTITY_JFK . What they 'll do is schedule the ride for your group and give you a reservation number and phone number to call once you arrive at the airport . Then they 'll tell you the car or van number to look for . It 's really easy . On the return to the airport , the hotel concierge desk will make the call fo you .

Do 3 things before if you find one you you think you might like . Check it out on line at least at 4 different sites you want the best price . then before you book it call and ask the price sometimes they will give you a better price on the phone . Always act as comparison shopping and say some one else was like ten dollars cheaper they seem to go down in price then . Good Luck

Fare is about $ 12 one way or $ 20 for roundtrip . All of you can get on the bus together . Otherwise , van service is really crappy and it takes forever b/c the drivers try to cram in as many people as they can - you 're better off just hiring a car service . The cheapest decent hotel I know of is the Clarion on Park Avenue . It 's small but the rooms are clean and cozy . It 's 2 stops on the 6 train from ENTITY_Grand_Central . Subway is one block from the hotel .
