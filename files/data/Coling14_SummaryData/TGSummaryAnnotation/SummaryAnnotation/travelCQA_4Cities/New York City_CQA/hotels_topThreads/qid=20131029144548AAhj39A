All the ones I 've ever stayed at were clean and well run and include free breakfast . You might want to check that the free airport shuttle would drop you off directly at the ENTITY_New_Jersey_Transit station , rather than having to first go to the airport . That would save you the fare for the AirTrain monorail from the airport to the train station . Interesting that the Bowery is now considered -LRB- at least by the hotel -RRB- to be the `` best part of town '' ... I know that it 's no longer skid-row , but `` best part of town '' ?

Certainly saves time . Otherwise you could just wing it . As you arrive and travel around go to some of the no name boutique hotels and motels they are everywhere and may not have a great online presence but they could be great for cheap rooms and cost less than many of the chains .
