Take a ride on the ENTITY_Staten_Island_Ferry and see the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty as the ferry crosses the harbor . 2 . Tour of the city on a double decker bus 3 . A walk across the ENTITY_Brooklyn Bridge 4 . See the city from the top of the Empire State Building What ever you do , do n't go to Times Square on New Year 's Eve , because it is a mess . Plus you will have to deal with security measure at The Crossroad of the World . I hope this information is very helpful . Happy New Year

In the evening / Night you could also go up either the ENTITY_Rockefeller or Empier State building . That can all be done in one day . There is also Madame Tussads which is in ENTITY_Times_Sqaure . If you go to the bus tour shop in TS they have free booklets on what is on in the ENTITY_City also free maps ! The weather will be very cold !! So wrap you warm ! A must thing to take is a camera . . Everywhere you go !! You can also go to a mall either in ENTITY_Queens or ENTITY_Manhatten . Have a great trip - I 'm going in february and i also went earlier this year it 's amazing ! x

It was one of the worst experiences of my life . I really cant stress it enough . I would have to be paid over 10k just to deal with that again.There will be plenty of things to do without having to deal with that mess . Try visting The Village , ENTITY_Soho , ENTITY_Chinatown , Ground zero , ENTITY_Central_Park area , ect ect ... The weather is expected to be average for this time of year . Probably around 40 in day , and near at 30 at night .
