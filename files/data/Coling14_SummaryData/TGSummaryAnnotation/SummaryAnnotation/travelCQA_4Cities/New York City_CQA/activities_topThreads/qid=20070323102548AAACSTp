We got tickets to the All loops tour bus , where you can ride , and hop on and off . We went to the Statue of Liberty , Empire State Building , the World Trade Center site , ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center . Everyone kept telling us to go see a show , which we never did , so I suggest that as well . I 've heard that Wicked is a really good one . There is sooo much to see !! Times Square is also VERY cool if you 've never seen it before . At night it 's like daytime because the lights are so bright . Be prepared to do alot of walking ... and have FUN !!!

The natural history museum is great . Walk around Times Square , Go to the top of the Empire State Building , Walk around Central Park , Eat at a restaurant you do n't have where you live , go to a comedy club , go shopping , take the ENTITY_Staten_Island_Ferry , or go to the Statue of Liberty . Those are all the things I love to do when I take someone to ENTITY_NYC . Have fun1

It 's wall to wall corporate eateries and the streets are clogged like ENTITY_Spring_Break used to be in Ft Laudedale back in the day . You could almost pick up Times Square and drop it in `` any town ENTITY_USA '' and get the same thrill . What 's left of the NYC nightlife is downtown -LRB- Village , etc. -RRB- . I 'd recommend planning things out in advance or you 'll just end up wasting time being overwhelmed . You might wan na check out this website : NYCTouristCenter.com . -LRB- http://www.nyctouristcenter.com -RRB- . I always refer this site to friends planning a trip to NYC .

Also check out some of the insanely cheap shopping there . The ENTITY_South_Street_Seaport is something different to do in the city , it 's downtown by the sea . Check out Times Square , but do n't eat there , unless you must . Try to take in a Broadway show if at all possible . Go to ENTITY_Greenwich_Village . ENTITY_Washington_Square_Park is quite nice , and there are several cheap restaurants , as it 's a heavily student-populated area.Union Square is also good for shopping . If you can afford it , check out ENTITY_Madison_Avenue for some high-end shopping . A walk around Central Park would also be nice , while you 're at it . If you want to go to the Statue of Liberty , you should know the wait is usually quite long , but if you really want to go , do n't let the wait deter you .

You should go up the empire state building as you will see new york in one go . You have to go shopping in macys . You can go on a helicopter ride or may be go on one of the boat tours there is so much to do there . But if you have a short time there its best to see as much as you can have a nice trip
