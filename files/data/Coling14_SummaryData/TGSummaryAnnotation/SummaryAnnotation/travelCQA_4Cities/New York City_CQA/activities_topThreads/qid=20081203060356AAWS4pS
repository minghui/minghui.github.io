qid=20081203060356AAWS4pS_answer_1	1	qid=20081203060356AAWS4pS	2008-12-03 14:20:17 +0000	best_answer	 There will be a crowd at Rockefeller Center , but I still enjoy seeing the tree after so many years . Nearby , the windows of ENTITY_Saks or Lord and ENTITY_Taylor on 5th avenue are fun . Go a bit off the beaten path to avoid the ENTITY_Jersey crowds . Check the nytimes online for things to do . There is also ENTITY_New_York magazine online and The Onion -LRB- AV section -RRB- . I do n't know your taste in music , but there are usually lots of concerts in the city on a weekend , some free . While the trees are bare in Central Park , a walk -LRB- during daylight hours -RRB- is fun . The southern loop has the carousel , the `` imagine '' garden and the wolman skating rink . South of central park is columbus circle with the time warner center , with lots of stores , bars , restaurants and a light/sound show in the central hall . Downstairs at Whole foods is popular for a quick and yummi snack and you can sit down to eat . From columbus circle , take the A , C or D train to West 4 , where you are in the middle of the ENTITY_Greenwiich_Village . Music , food , bars , people watching and great stores . You can walk from the village south to broadway where serious shopping starts below ENTITY_Houston -LRB- rhymes with mouse , please -RRB- St. You can then veer off into ENTITY_Soho or go east to the east village , which is pretty exciting . If you are lost , ask a native . We like to help visitors -LRB- well , at least a good number of us -RRB- . At that point you may be exhausted from all the fun or walking . Perhaps you contemplate moving to NYC so all this fun can be yours every day . Have fun .
