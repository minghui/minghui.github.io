Explore Times Square and ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center , then head downtown to the ENTITY_West_Village and ENTITY_Soho . I would go to Union Square , especially if it is warm or ENTITY_Washington_Square_Park . Time Square is great to visit at night . Taking the subway is the cheapest way to get around . There are great places to get a cheap meal , ENTITY_Rays_Pizza , ENTITY_Gray 's Papaya or Suzies Chinese restaurant on Bleeker Street . The area around ENTITY_New_York_University has some reasonable places to grab a drink or a meal . If you really want to explore try some of the ENTITY_Downtown_Brooklyn area as well . It is like a little ENTITY_Manhattan .

Plan to walk along 5th Avenue and see all the fancy stores ... Visit Central Park and walk around ... Check out The ENTITY_Staten_Island Ferry -LRB- near Ground Zero , in ENTITY_Downtown_Manhattan . -RRB- You can take the Ferry round trip , back & forth to ENTITY_Staten_Island . It 's free ! It 's normally for commuters from ENTITY_Staten_Island , but anyone can take it . Great views of the harbor and lower ENTITY_Manhattan . Do n't be afraid to just pop into McDonald 's for lunch , or grab a hotdog from a street vendor . Welcome to ENTITY_New_York !
