You may find interesting places you will want to go back to . Times Square , many Broadway shows are not held on Mondays . So , if you wan na see a lot of people skip Mondays . If you wan na save some money , try going to an Off or even Off-Off Broadway show . Whole bunch of free concerts and movies during the summer . ENTITY_Bryant_Park , `` ENTITY_Hudson_River_Flicks '' , ENTITY_River to ENTITY_River_Festival , Today Show concerts on Fridays , `` Movies With a View '' next to the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge . ENTITY_Hoboken even has `` Movies Under the Stars '' ; in a park right along ENTITY_Hudson_River so behind the screen is city skyline . ENTITY_Hoboken has a lot of bars within walking distance . Easy PATH train to get there . I would n't do Empire State Building . Go to ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center 's `` Top of the Rock '' . You get to see the Empire State Building AND Central Park . Central Park . ENTITY_Greenwich_Village . ENTITY_Chinatown . Little ENTITY_Italy on a weekend day . Fifth Avenue shopping . ENTITY_Yankee game . The stadium ai n't gon na be there next year .

This way , you will save enough time to tour other parts of the city :-RRB- http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/tourâ€?there's also the famous BULL at the financial district :-RRB- you should also try the yummiest ENTITY_Pizza_Margherita at ` Lil Frankie in East Village ^ , ^ if you have more time , try walking the stretch of ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge . http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/travâ€?this serves as an exercise too . . hihihi also , do visit ENTITY_Saint_Patricks 's Cathedral at 5th avenue . do n't miss to go inside . it 's wonderful !!! we also went to Top of the Rock instead of the Empire State Building to avoid the long line hihihi because we were afraid we wo n't have enough time to see other parts of NYC :-RRB- for shopping , you may want to visit Century 21 , just across the former WTC . http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/liviâ€?you should have lunch/brunch at Cafe lalo !!! or at ENTITY_Sarabeth 's :-RRB- we chose ENTITY_Cafe_Lalo hihihi because of the ambiance and because it 's famous . To relax , try having a picnic at Central Park . http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/laboâ€?we chose to eat at the top of one huge rock there to have e good view of the whole central park :-RRB- then , we went to MET -LRB- entrance is by donation only , you do n't have to give 20 USD -RRB- if you 're a techie like my friends , you may want to visit the MAC store . it is now a tourist spot because of its unique architecture :p DO N'T MISS eating at PARADOU !!! it 's a MUST !!! trust me on this ! you also got ta watch a broadway show ! definitely ! there 's WICKED and SPAMALOT :-RRB- http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/goodâ€?
