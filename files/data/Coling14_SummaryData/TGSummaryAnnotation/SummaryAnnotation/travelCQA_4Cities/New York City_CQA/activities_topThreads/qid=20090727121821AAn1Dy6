Go see the tree in Rockefeller Center and maybe catch the ENTITY_Rockettes , but you got ta look for tickets like now if you want to have them for this Christmas . Look around midtown for some of the best decorated windows in the world . Get a guide book to tell you all you want to know . You can take a double decker bus ride around town , but sit downstairs and inside cause it can be REALLY cold here in the winter . On piece of advice . unless you know what you are doing try to stay in tourist friendly midtown or in ENTITY_Manhattan and unless you really know what you are doing , stay out of the ENTITY_Bronx .

ENTITY_New_York never looks better than it does aroung the Holidays . The drawback is that hotel prices are very high during that time and in general airfares are as well .
