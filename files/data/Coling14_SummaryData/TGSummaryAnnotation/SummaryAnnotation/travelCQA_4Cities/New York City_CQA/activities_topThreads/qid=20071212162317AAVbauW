It 's amazing ! So many business open and the same amount of people on the street as 3:00 pm ! WALK , take a taxi only if you have to . It 's amazing the shops and cafes you miss when you are in a taxi . ENTITY_FYI_Empire_State building is different during the day and I think more beautiful at night ! HAVE FUN !

You can go through TKTS -LRB- www.tdf.org/tkts -RRB- to get discount tickets . However , they wo n't be for all shows , so if you have your heart set on a particular one , buy it now ! They may sell out ! One I think both men and women would love is Avenue Q. It 's quite crass but hilarious . Wicked is also amazing and great for all . If you want to splurge , have dinner at ENTITY_Nobu . Walk around the shopping district . In the evening , go up the Empire State Building and check out the view . If it 's not too cold , check out ENTITY_Central_Park . Also , the ENTITY_Guggenheim museum would be a great group activity . If you 're going to Time Square to see the ball drop , go early and dress warm . Bring diapers too . Have fun !
