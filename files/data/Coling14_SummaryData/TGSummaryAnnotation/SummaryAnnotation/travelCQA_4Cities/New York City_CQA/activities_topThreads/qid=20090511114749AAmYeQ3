Catch a Broadway show -- i suggest Drowsy chaperone ... loved it and its funny and visually stunning ... -LRB- not lion king -RRB- I heard wicked was good . I think Empire state building is soooo overrated ... there is a new observation place called Top of the rock on ENTITY_Rockefeller center with better views . http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763â€?Shopping: Everywhere in ENTITY_Manhattan ... Times square ; 34th street -LRB- ENTITY_Macy_'s -RRB- Take the L train to ENTITY_Brooklyn -LRB- take it in 34th -RRB- get off on ENTITY_Bedford . . its like a 7 minute ride . When you get out ask for ENTITY_SEA . Its a thai restaurant . You 'll thank me later ... good food and goooood price . http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Reâ€?have fun !

The ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty and ENTITY_Ellise_Island are a full day excursion but you have to get there early in the morning to get a ticket so I would say skip them for now . I would stick to mid town ENTITY_Manhattan . See Rockefeller plaza including the Top of the Rock for the best view of the city and take the ENTITY_Radio_City tour . Then go to Time Square and if you like art then head over to ENTITY_MoMA . That would be a full day .

View the whole City and about three states from the 86th Floor of the Empire State Building . 2 . Take a nice walk cross the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge . 3 . Visit the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty 4 .

Will you get back there again any time soon , or is this your one big NYC trip ? Will you be there at night ? Do you have ANY plans to work around ? I would say skip the Empire State building unless you want to pay to skip to the front of the line - it takes a lot of time , which you do n't have . ENTITY_South_Street_sea port will be a crowded tourist trap . The south part of ENTITY_Central_Park , with a ENTITY_Hansen carriage ride , is touristy but worth the time and money .
