I think in 5 or 6 days you can catch the highlights though . I suggest seeing Times Square , Empire state building , ENTITY_Greenwich_village , statue of liberty , ENTITY_china town , south street seaport , battery park , little italy , world trade center site , untied nations , central park , ENTITY_Rockefeller center , ENTITY_Chrysler building , and the ENTITY_Russian and Turkish baths . This sounds like a lot , but you do n't spend that long anywhere .

A satisfactory first-time visit might take 5 days . Day One . Visit one really famous tourist attraction . Say , the Statue of Liberty of the Empire State Building . Spend the rest of the day just walking around , taking in the people , going to a nice restaurant -LRB- not all NYC restaurants demand that you take out a second mortgage to eat there -- some are merely expenses , and others are a real bargain ! -RRB- Travel by subway . Do n't take taxis . Day Two take in another well-known NY site , like Ground Zero . You can also take in ENTITY_City_Hall and the Wall Street area and Battery Park on the same day . Day Three . Museum Day . Go to ONE museum . Spend the entire day there . the ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History is especially great if you have kids with you . Day Four . Travel a bit . Go to either the ENTITY_Bronx_Zoo , or take in a ball game , or visit a particular neighborhood like ENTITY_Chinatown or the ENTITY_West_Village. , Take in a Broadway show . Day Five . Go to Central Park . Visit one of the interesting neighborhoods abutting it , like Central Park South -LRB- the Plaza Hotel , ENTITY_Bergdorf_Goodman , ENTITY_Tiffany 's -RRB- the places where they broadcast TV Early Show , expensive ritzy hotels and the smell of horses There will be a lot you will miss . There always is . Save it for next time .

We went from early morning till late at night -LRB- or even early the next morning -RRB- and still did n't see everything . You just have to decide which attractions are most important to you . Things we saw and did were ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty , ENTITY_Ellis_Island , Empire State Bldg , ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center , Top of the Rock , Today show , Ground Zero , ENTITY_St_Patrick 's Cathedral , walked ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge , Grand Central Terminal -LRB- whispering wall -RRB- , Central Park bike taxi ride , 4 Broadway shows , Times Square , ENTITY_China_Town , ENTITY_Little_Italy , ENTITY_SoHo , ENTITY_Greenwich_Village , Trump Tower , Plaza Hotel , ENTITY_Bloomingdale 's , ENTITY_Macy_'s -LRB- largest store in the world -RRB- , we took a Harbor cruise , we took the hop on/off tour bus around ENTITY_Manhattan and to ENTITY_Harlem , we rode the subway -LRB- just for fun -RRB- , ate at ENTITY_Carmine_'s , Burger Joint , Serendipity , Juniors and the hot dog vendor . Naturally we spent more time at some places than others , but we can say we saw them . We did n't have time to go to any of the museums . The museums , the ENTITY_South_Street_Seaport and touring the ENTITY_Burroughs , will be for the next trip . You 'll have so much fun .

Anything you do n't get time to do simply plan for a longer trip next time .
