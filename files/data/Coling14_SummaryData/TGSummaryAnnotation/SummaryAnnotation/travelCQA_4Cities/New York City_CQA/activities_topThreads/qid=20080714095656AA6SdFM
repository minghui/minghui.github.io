Check them out during the weekend . Metropolitan museum , as was mentioned before , is on a donation basis , so you can give a $ 1 ! ENTITY_MOMA -LRB- Museum of Modern Art -RRB- is free on Fridays after 6PM , so is ENTITY_Gugenheim_Museum , if you 're into museums . In terms of the view , the ferry that goes to ENTITY_Staten_Island is free , and you can take great pictures of the Statue of Liberty from the upper deck -LRB- as well as gorgeous pictures of downtown ENTITY_Manhattan -RRB- . ENTITY_Chelsea piers and ENTITY_South_Street seaport entry is free , and you can roam around as you please , but obviously all the shopping and dining will cost you .

This way , you will save enough time to tour other parts of the city :-RRB- http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/tourâ€?there's also the famous BULL at the financial district :-RRB- you should also try the yummiest ENTITY_Pizza_Margherita at ` Lil Frankie in East Village ^ , ^ if you have more time , try walking the stretch of ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge . http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/travâ€?this serves as an exercise too . . hihihi also , do visit ENTITY_Saint_Patricks 's Cathedral at 5th avenue . do n't miss to go inside . it 's wonderful !!! we also went to Top of the Rock instead of the Empire State Building to avoid the long line hihihi because we were afraid we wo n't have enough time to see other parts of NYC :-RRB- for shopping , you may want to visit Century 21 , just across the former WTC . http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/liviâ€?you should have lunch/brunch at Cafe lalo !!! or at ENTITY_Sarabeth 's :-RRB- we chose ENTITY_Cafe_Lalo hihihi because of the ambiance and because it 's famous . To relax , try having a picnic at Central Park . http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/laboâ€?we chose to eat at the top of one huge rock there to have e good view of the whole central park :-RRB- then , we went to MET -LRB- entrance is by donation only , you do n't have to give 20 USD -RRB- if you 're a techie like my friends , you may want to visit the MAC store . it is now a tourist spot because of its unique architecture :p DO N'T MISS eating at PARADOU !!! it 's a MUST !!! trust me on this ! you also got ta watch a broadway show ! definitely ! there 's WICKED and SPAMALOT :-RRB- http://jotan23.blogspot.com/2008/03/goodâ€?
