As my mother and I have had a tough year , I thought I 'd treat her with this year 's christmas present being a 3 day shopping trip to ENTITY_New_York - we 'd leave on or a day before Monday 20th Dec 2010 and probably return on Thursday 23rd - but I do n't know if it would be cheaper to book now or to wait and try to get a last minute deal a week or so beforehand ... has anyone done this before and have any advice ?? or a recommendation for somewhere to stay while over there ?? any help would be greatly appreciated ! : -RRB-

Once you get your hotel confirmed you can continue to look around for better deals . Most hotels have a 24 hour cancellation policy . Keep in mind that it can be difficult at times to find a room with two beds in it . I would suggest staying in ENTITY_midtown_Manhattan . If you are going to be shopping you will want a close place to drop off your packages . It is hard to suggest hotels without knowing your budget . Here at some hotels I like The Shoreham The Dream The Empire The Time The ENTITY_Warwick -LRB- kind of old fashioned but with nice sized rooms -RRB- The ENTITY_Hudson -LRB- tiny , tiny rooms but great public space -RRB- Also , even though I can not stand Times Square I was very pleasantly surprised with the ENTITY_Marriott_Marquis . The rooms were nice and big and the staff was great . Totally unexpected .

There is no better hotel , shopping is near , restaurants are right there , and most theaters are within walking distance . The subway is within walking distance as well , and ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center is n't too far . If you book in advance , and plans change you can always cancel .

In regards to a place to stay . Well , that depends on how much you 're willing to spend for a room at night . Christmas time is the big time money maker for hotels here in the city . The links below will be very helpful . Good luck ENTITY_Native_New_Yorker

Without a doubt prices will only go up and do yourself another favor use ENTITY_kayak.com -LRB- http://www.kayak.com -RRB- this site compares ALL the sites INCLUDING ENTITY_Priceline and ENTITY_Expedia and this way you 'll know you 're getting the absolute best price . As to `` where '' to stay this all depends on your budget . Regardless , I recommend avoiding Times Square . It 's perfectly safe but it is way over priced as are the restaurants and shops in the area . You 'll do much better if you look for a hotel on the ENTITY_East_Side and the advantage is most of the shopping is located on the ENTITY_East_Side in particular on Fifth and Madison Avenues . Hotel you might want to check include : The ENTITY_New_York_Palace -LRB- 4.5 star hotel -RRB- located on ENTITY_Madison and only steps to ENTITY_Saks Fifth Avenue http://www.newyorkpalace.com/ Hotel Chandler -LRB- 3.5 hotel -RRB- located on East 31st between 5th & Madison http://www.hotelchandler.com/ ENTITY_Radisson_Lexington -LRB- 3 star hotel -RRB- located on ENTITY_Lexington at 48th Street http://www.radisson.com/newyork-hotel-10â€?I hope this helps a bit and wishing you and your Mom a better year in 2011 .
