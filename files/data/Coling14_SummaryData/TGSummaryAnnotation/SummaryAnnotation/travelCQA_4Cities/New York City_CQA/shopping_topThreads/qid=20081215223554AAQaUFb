Along the way were several small grocery stores . I 'd stop and buy what I needed for dinner that night , and , yes , I 'd just buy two bags full . It 's funny , because I 'd grown up in the suburbs and was used to driving to the supermarket . When we moved out of ENTITY_Brooklyn and I was back in the suburbs , the first time I went shopping , I bought two bags worth of stuff , grabbed my bags and gave my cart to a guy who needed one . I was very pregnant at the time , and the cashier thought the man was terrible to take my cart , but , honestly , I 'd forgotten I could take it to the car : - -RRB-

I use mine to carry my laundry to the laundromat . Also , at least in my neighborhood , there are grocery stores everywhere . Just on my block we have 2 bodegas , a fruit store , a supermarket and a meat market .

I 've taken the bus -LRB- slow hours -RRB- with 6 bags with no problem then walk upstairs to the top floor . Always a friggin joy !! Ya ' got ta do whatcha got ta do ! @

Many people use personal metal carts as noted above . Some have to carry their groceries on a bus or subway , but you still have to figure out how to get to and from the bus stop or train station so bags and carts are still relevant . Bear in mind also that most of us live in small apartments with tiny kitchen/pantries , so we 're not really able to take advantage of sales and buy 18 boxes of something at a time anyway . Also , many grocery stores will deliver to the immediate neighborhood -LRB- i.e. someone on their staff pushes your cart to your apartment building later in the day -RRB- either for a small fee or free if you buy over a certain $ limit . ENTITY_FreshDirect , a company that allows you to order groceries online and have them delivered , has also become very popular among wealthy New Yorkers .

There are also some supermarkets that offer walking delivery , where they have a delivery guy that will walk home with you while pushing groceries in one of the supermarket shopping carts , if you live on a top floor just give him a nice tip and he 'll make as many trips as it takes to get all your groceries upstairs and then take the grocery cart back to the supermarket .

You just have to learn how to `` eyeball '' how much food you 've got . . and figure out how to fit it all in the cart without it fallout out all over the place . It takes some practice , but it 's easier than lugging bags -LRB- though I 'd usually have an extra bag that would n't fit , and end up carrying that in one hand and pushing the cart with the other . -RRB-
