This is the last year for it , it is a fun place to be ! Central Park is BEAUTIFUL and on the weekends there is always a lot going on ! Go to South Street Seaport , another fun place especially on Sat . 's ! Take a FREE ride on the ENTITY_Staten_Island Ferry , you can see everything from lower ENTITY_Manhattan to the Statue of ENTITY_Liberty and lot 's more for free ! Eat , food in NYC is some of the very best ever ! ENTITY_Queens_Center_Mall is the best mall in my opinion , so many stores ! Best pizza -LRB- again in my opinion -RRB- is ENTITY_Bella_Vita on 59th and 6th Most yummy after dinner treat , Crumbs bakery !! -LRB- check out their website ! -RRB- ENTITY_Best subway train ride to see the city is the 7 Train going to ENTITY_Queens . ENTITY_Time_Warner_Building_in_Columbus_Circle is also VERY cool to go explore ! Especially the ENTITY_Samsung_Center_! Kid 's and adults can play with anything they like AND you can even take your picture and turn it into a post card ! Toy R Us in Times Square is amazing for children and far better priced than ENTITY_FAO I do not care how old or young you are , check out the Natural History Museum , so much fun ! My fav . upscale restaurant is Tavern on the ENTITY_Green . It is upscale yet family friendly and most kids love the idea of getting dressed up and eating there !

Prince and West Broadway 153 ENTITY_Prince_Street_New_York , ENTITY_New_York 10012 . You 're going to have a lot of fun !! If you like arcades and games and such you should also go to Mars 2112 Restaurant and Bar : 1633 Broadway At 51 Street ENTITY_New_York , ENTITY_New_York 10019 . You 'll have a lot of fun at both of these places

You will have a much more fun -LRB- read : cooler -RRB- experience if you do n't do all the touristy things like buying an I < 3NY teeshirt . Also the natives are a lot nicer to the people who are n't blatantly tourists . -LRB- BTW this advice works for just about anywhere in the world ! -RRB- My suggestions are the ENTITY_MoMA , ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art , ENTITY_Museum_of_Nat_History , taking a picnic in Central Park , ENTITY_Chinatown , Times Square -LRB- wax museum is awesome , this is in Times Square -RRB- ... and shopping of course . ENTITY_SoHo is a cool place to hang out .

If you 're staying by a train station , try and pick up a copy of the NYC Subway map . Buy an unlimited WEEKLY metrocard . You can use it as many times as you need to for your week 's stay . You can hop on a train and it 'll take you just about anywhere you need to go . Have fun !
