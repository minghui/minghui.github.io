PS : they have coach in woodbury . but if u are talking about the fake goods , ENTITY_chinatown has them . like what the other answerers answered . we 're having christmas sales nationwide now so do shop now ! hope this helps . happy shopping ! : -RRB-

Yes , there are many . The area is full of tourist and you ca n't even move ... but you can definitely buy it there . It really depends what you want to buy . There are so many different type of stores and so many areas , but I will try to be quick and short : 1 -RRB- Union Square -LRB- from Broadway to 8th Avenue -RRB- . You will find stores like Basement , ENTITY_Virgin_Store , ENTITY_Urban_Outfitters , ENTITY_Diesel , Forever 21 plus a bunch of small stores -LRB- good price -RRB- 2 -RRB- 34th Street -LRB- from 5th Avenue to 8th Avenue -RRB- . Again another area with a bunch of stores such as ENTITY_H&M , Gap , Forever , ENTITY_Victoria_'s , ENTITY_Express , Macys , Old ENTITY_Navy and much more ... It is really crowded there ... 3 -RRB- Fifth Avenue -LRB- between 20th Street to 14th Street -RRB- . I highly recomend because no many tourist know of these stores so you will be shopping with New Yorkers . ENTITY_H&M , ENTITY_Zara , ENTITY_Club_Monaco , Banana , Gap , ENTITY_Armani_Xchange , ENTITY_Bebe , ENTITY_Arden_B. , ENTITY_Diesel , and much more . then you can walk all the way to ENTITY_Union_Square and continue to shop . 4 -RRB- ENTITY_Soho : Spring and Price super cool area for shopping but a bit expensive . 5 -RRB- For cool and interesting stores -LRB- but also worth it to visit -RRB- go to St. Marks in the ENTITY_East_Village . Walk from 4th Avenue towards 1st Avenue . 6 -RRB- ENTITY_West_Village is cool also Also through Bleecker for a bunch of cool stores . Oh I just remembered : if you are going to chinatown just to buy fake purses you may not need to go all the way there . Go to ENTITY_59th_Street_&_Lexington_Avenue by ENTITY_Bloomingdales . Near Zara on 59th there are always some ENTITY_African dudes with large black sachs selling fake purses ... check as well . Good luck .
