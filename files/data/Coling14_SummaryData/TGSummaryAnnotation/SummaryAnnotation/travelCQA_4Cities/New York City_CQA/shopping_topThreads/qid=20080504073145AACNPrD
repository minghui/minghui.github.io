Your daughter might like the ENTITY_American_Girl_Store and Cafe . There is also a show there . You have to make reservations in advance for the show and the cafe . The food in the cafe was good and reasonably priced . The store is a vacation in and of itself . Take her to ENTITY_Serendipity 2 for Frozen Hot Chocolate . Make reservations now or you will spend hours in line . THe food is n't great , but the Frozen Hot Chocolate is to die for . There is a book that I found at our library -LRB- ca n't remember the exact title -RRB- , something like ENTITY_NYC with kids or teens or something . It had some good ideas in it . Of course , ENTITY_Time_Square_and_Toys_R_Us . These are right near the theater where LB is playing . Have fun !!
