The ENTITY_American_Girl_Store . Yes , you might spend a fortune there , but little girl 's just love it ! The Bronx Zoo , or the Central Park Zoo . Both of these zoos are operated by the same non-profit - the ENTITY_NY_Wildlife_Foundation . The Bronx Zoo is HUGE and the only place to see really big animals .

The ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History - my kids never get tired of this one ! Take a ride on the ENTITY_Staten_Island_Ferry - It 's fun , it 's free , and you can see the Stature of Liberty from there . What 's not to like ? The Metropolitan Museum - while not a kid 's museum , there are some great places for kids inside ! At the Met , you can take them to the ENTITY_Temple_of_Dendur -LRB- my kids love that ! -RRB- Go see the Arms and Armor exhibit . Go look at all the Egyptian Galleries . Or take in the Costume exhibit . There are also lot 's of kids activities in ENTITY_NYC over the weekends and during school holidays . Check out the Friday Weekend Section of the ENTITY_NY_Times . It always has great cultural adventures for kids listed there . There are some great children 's theater companies in NYC ! Have fun !
