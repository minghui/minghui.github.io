I was born and raised in ENTITY_Long_Island , NY and back in 2002 I moved out to ENTITY_Michigan due to a much needed career change made by my father . I 've been back to ENTITY_New_York twice since then , once to stay in ENTITY_Manhattan for a week and another to attend a funeral . the fact is , I love the city , everything about it makes me smile . Both the good and the bad . im always asked why dont you visit more if you love it so much ? my response is always the same , I cant do that to myself . Each time i go back i want to stay . I think im finally ready to make my dream a reality and make the move . my whole family lives here in ENTITY_Michigan but im willing to take the chance and see if I can make it . Right now i work for an Indirect Sprint store and I love what I do , Sales . my friend has offered to room with me in the city and I can stay with him as long as I like in ENTITY_Long_Island until I find a job or a living situation I can do . Im looking at moving by May 2009 and by that time I 'll have $ 10,000 saved , an associates degree and two years of sales experience . My defense is the fact that I think about it all the time , im 21 years old , I am really good at sales , and i have NO debt and this is the best time for it in my opinion before I accumulate debt , find a job with serious promotion or basically just get comfortable . My question to everyone is this : Do you think I should do it ? if you were me would you ? and if so , what steps should I take ? Email me if you want more info .

There are many areas of NYC , you can find out which one is best suited to your needs . There are some good family-oriented areas in ENTITY_Brooklyn , ENTITY_Queens and ENTITY_Bronx that are n't that expensive , but if you want to live a decent -LRB- and by that I do n't mean luxurious -RRB- life in ENTITY_Manhattan , you need to have a six-figure salary . Well , unless you want to live in cheaper areas of ENTITY_Manhattan like ENTITY_Harlem , which I 'm pretty sure you do n't want to - and even they 're fairly expensive . So decide which area of NYC is best for you to live - every area is vibrant and boasts a great lifestyle . You do n't have any debt on you , which is very good -LRB- considering your age -RRB- , but I hope that you 're in a managerial position in sales jobs if you want to live a good life in NYC .
