If you are going into the city , some of the highlights include Times Square , ENTITY_Chinatown the Empire State Building , and definitely ENTITY_Rockefeller . In ENTITY_Chinatown you can get a lot of things including purses and gifts for very reasonable prices here . This Wednesday is the ENTITY_Lighting_of_the_Rockefeller tree , so you could be in town for that , and ENTITY_Rockefeller also has stores , restaurants , and an ice-skating rink . Have fun !

I highly suggest wearing MORE than what is in your profile pic -LRB- although , thanks for allowing us to look -RRB- . It 'll likely be very cold compared to what you 're used to but not too crazy cold ... 30 's to 40 's . Maybe a heavy coat , no open-toed shoes ... and a scarf . If 30 sounds super chilly , get some ear muffs too . As for `` What to do '' vs `` what not to do '' ... If you 're new to ENTITY_New_York , go into the big city and just cruise around . Take taxis ... do NOT drive in the city . There 's a trillion things to do in ENTITY_New_York ... go explore ! OH , if you plan on renting a car and driving it , i highly suggest bringing a portable GPS . You 're going to need it . BTW , if you have extra time on your hands ... drive out to upstate new york ... a lot nicer there than the big city . You can drive up to ENTITY_Niagara_Falls and enjoy the view .
