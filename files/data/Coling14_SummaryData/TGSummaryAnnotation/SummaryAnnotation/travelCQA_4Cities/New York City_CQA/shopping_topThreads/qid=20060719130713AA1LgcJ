I 'm a ENTITY_California girl but will be visiting ENTITY_New_York this January for buisness . My normal idea of dressing for cold weather is jeans and a sweater . What should I expect when visiting NY in January ? What kinds of clothing should I get to make sure I do n't get cold ? Also , I heard that people wear boots to walk around in , but once they reach their destination they change into nice shoes - where do they put their shoes when they get there and how do they lug them around ?

Some winters up here can get realllly cold . You could go with layering if you wanted to take things off if you get hot , but I doubt that would happen . Well , if theres no snow or ice on the ground then you could just wear your nice shoes and take the subway or a taxi . But if you are walking a long distance and/or there is snow or ice , then wear boots or at least comfortable shoes . Just take a nice plastic bag with handles and I 'm sure you can just leave them with your coat while your inside at a meeting or something .

Next , if you are coming for business , where a warm suit , and the boots and carry nice shoes in your briefcase/messenger bag . Or depending on the weather that day , you may be a bit chilly but could wear the nice shoes . Also bring jeans and a sweater for when you do n't dress up . But it is windy , snowy and cold up here in the ENTITY_Northeast .
