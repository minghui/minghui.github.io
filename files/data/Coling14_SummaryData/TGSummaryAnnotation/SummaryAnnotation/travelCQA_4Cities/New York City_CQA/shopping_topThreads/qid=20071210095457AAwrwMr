Just check the internet and compare prices , last time my wife and I went we stayed at the ENTITY_Radisson_Lexington , good location , reasonable prices and pretty good room . You will most likely be taking cabs everywhere , 5th avenue is walking distance from downtown ENTITY_Manhattan hotels , plus its a nice walk , you pass lots of cool places on the way . To do the sight seeing thing , i would recommend hopping on tour buses , they are very cheap and you can get on and off where you like , your hotel will give you a flyer or info on that , plus they have organisers on many street corners . Just remember to secure your cash / credit cards as for any place you travel , if you go to Canal street for bargain purses / watches etc , be careful of entering back street buildings , common sense stuff . You will have a blast , there are tons of awesome restaurants , just try them out . Enjoy !!!

You can check the Internet and call around asking for specials but you will have a very hard time finding something . Your best bet is to stay at a hostel - check out Jazz on the Park . Very affordable , clean and provides a room to sleep which should be fine if you are going to be out exploring . Also consider ENTITY_Brooklyn and ENTITY_New_Jersey as both are affordable and easy to get back and forth from . Also consider the Couch Surfing project - might get luck !

I 'd suggest you check the holiday inn on 57th street it 's quite near central park and we found it clean cheap and cheerful . I 've also noticed alot of people mention a hotel called 30 30 no sure what it 's like though .
