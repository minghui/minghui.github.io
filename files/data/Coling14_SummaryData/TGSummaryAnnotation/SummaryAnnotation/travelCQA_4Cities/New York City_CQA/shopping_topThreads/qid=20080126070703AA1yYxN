I am going on a day trip to ENTITY_NYC with a small group -LRB- 3 to 5 people -RRB- and I have a few questions about ENTITY_Canal_St. . . 1 - What time do shops usually open/close ? 2 - I 've heard from other friends who have gone -LRB- but are not going on the trip -RRB- that they have gotten actual designer bags and such , but needed to follow the store owner to a different room . How safe is this -LRB- to those who have done so before -RRB- and is it necesary to find real designer bags ? 3 - I have read on answers that knock-offs are also sold on this street out in the open . Are these mostly on the street -LRB- which I have seen before -RRB- or in stores too , and could stores be carrying knock-offs and designer bags ? 4 - How much bartering can be done with the store owners ? Friends that have been on the street before said they were able to do so ? 5 - How crowded is it on a Saturday ? 6 - What else can I expect to see in the shops and on the street ? Feel free to share your experience . Thanks , and sorry for the multitude of questions .
qid=20080126070703AA1yYxN_answer_1	1	qid=20080126070703AA1yYxN	2008-01-26 17:12:02 +0000	best_answer	 1 - The shops are usually open pretty early . Merchants on Canal open roughly around 9 . Shops on ENTITY_Mott open later , some even earlier . 2 - Many times even the bags in the stores are knock-offs . Following a store owner into a back room to buy a bag that might not even be legit might not be the most dangerous activity in the world , but it probably is n't the smartest either . 3 - see above 4-Bartering is expected and almost encouraged . Do n't ever settle on the asking price . Haggling is the norm and you may find you 're going to pay less than what is originally quoted . 5 - It can get very crowded on the sidewalks on a Saturday afternoon . And what ever you do , do n't try to drive on Canal . 6 - Toys , bags , pirate dvds and cds , jewelry , etc. etc. .

ENTITY_Chinatown is special because of the Chinese merchandise . I have found lovely satin brocade shoulder bags , pretty brocade vests , beaded bracelets with silk tassels , quilted vests , Chinese slip-on scuffs with sequinned flowers ... and all sorts of fun things to buy . Go to lunch somewhere warm , get some steamed dumplings with sauce , a special fried rice and enjoy that nice steaming pot of Chinese tea they bring you . x

The stuff being sold on Canal street are forgeries and it 's illegal . That 's why all the secrecy . The merchants could get arrested and their inventory could get confiscated .

They met a lady on street and she had them follow her to something like a warehouse . At one point she made them run because she thought the police were coming . They got the bags , but they were scared out of their minds .

Ever . For ANY reason . There are enough other places to buy bags . It is not safe . There was an incident recently when the cops came and the sellers hid all the buyers . They were trapped there for hours ! Finally the cops found them and charged the sellers with kidnapping . Do you really want to get involved with all that for a BAG ? 3 - Knock-offs are in fact sold on Canal street out in the open . But yes , stores can be selling knock-offs too 4 - Bartering is almost expected . Know how much you want to spend and stick to that as your top price . You might get it . Start lower , walk away , then offer more when they call you back . 5 - It can be really crowded on a Saturday . 6 - They sell anything you can and can not think of on the street . Sunglasses , watches -LRB- knock-offs too -RRB- , slippers , fountains that spew smoke and cause large marble balls to spin . You name it . Well , actually you probably wo n't be able to .
