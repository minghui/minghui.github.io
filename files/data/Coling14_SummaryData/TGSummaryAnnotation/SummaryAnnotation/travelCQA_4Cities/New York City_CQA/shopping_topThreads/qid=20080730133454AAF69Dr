Yes , There 's so many things to do here ... all types of places to go to and all the different foods and different people ... Its a great experience 2 . Well if your living in ENTITY_Britain right now you 'd have to fly ... ENTITY_Delta is the best air company right now but ENTITY_american_airlines is okay . Anytime is really good to come to ENTITY_new_york . . But for your first time come in the summer . I think you 'd enjoy it better cuz its not so cold and its not always so hot . You could stay right in the city like ENTITY_manhattan thats usually where tourists go but im from ENTITY_brooklyn and its really nice here too ...

Do n't dream about getting a Hotel in ENTITY_Manhattan unless you have a few hundred quid to spend just on room and board . I ca n't recommend any good air companies but I can recommend that you go see Times Square or Broadway . If you can , come during the Ball Drop on New Years . Imagine a couple of hundred thousand people packed into an area a few city blocks large , all simultaneously counting down to the New Year . If you take the subway , keep your eyes down and do n't stare at anybody . It 's going to be pretty hard for you because you see the weirdest people on the train .
