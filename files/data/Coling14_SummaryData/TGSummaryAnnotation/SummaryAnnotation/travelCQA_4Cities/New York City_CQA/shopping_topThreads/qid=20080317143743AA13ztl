Go over 20 % only if you receive truly delightful service . Tip below 15 % only if the service was really bad . If it was completely awful and it was clearly the fault of your waiter rather than the kitchen , you should n't leave a tip at all -LRB- you might receive a nasty look but probably no words -RRB- . The folks who most commonly receive a tip are taxi drivers and restaurant waiters . If a bellhop carries your luggage into or out of a hotel , you tip about $ 1 per bag . If the hotel helps you get a cab , you tip about $ 1 . If your hotel has a concierge who helps you , provide a nice tip based on the service that was provided .

In terms of tipping , I would say 20 % of the bill -LRB- before tax -RRB- is pretty standard at restaurants and I usually leave about $ 2 tip for taxi drivers , unless its to or from the airport in which case I leave more like 5-7 dollars tip . Enjoy your trip !

You should give the driver at least a few dollars . They wo n't care because they 're happy with what they get .

My favorite place to shop is ENTITY_H&M on 5th Ave. and something like ... 45th St. Q # 2 leave about 20 % . in a restaurant double the tax if the service is ok , and double and a half if the waiter is cute . VERY IMPORTANT !! a lot of times a waiter will put T.S. = table service on u , double the tax if you look like a tourist or have an accent , so make sure u read the bill later and ask if the tip is included !! have fun !
