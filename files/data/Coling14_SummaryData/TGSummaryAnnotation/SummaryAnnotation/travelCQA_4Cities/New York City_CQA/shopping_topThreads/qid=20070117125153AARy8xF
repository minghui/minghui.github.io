I went last april with my gf for 4 days . Spent £1000 . Remember you hotel will be room only , so its gon na be 2 or 3 meals a day , and the food is not cheap there . We ate at some nice places tho . A 48 hour hop on hop off bus pass is a must !! You get lots of info , and can hop on and off where ever you want , it takes you all over the best places in ENTITY_manhattan . These are $ 50 each . Empire is about $ 12 each , cant remember tho . if you get a taxi from the airport , it will be around $ 60 each way . thats just a few things off the top of my head ! Take plenty of money trust me you will need it , it goes nowere in ENTITY_Manhattan , Other things to do are statue of liberty -LRB- you can get a free ferry around it but you cant get off that one , so thats not much cop really -RRB- ENTITY_Rockerfeller , which is supposed to be brill . Grand Central station , G Zero , loads of other stuff You will spend alot on food mainly , trust me just take plenty cash we got through a thousand quid no problems . Hope you have a great time
