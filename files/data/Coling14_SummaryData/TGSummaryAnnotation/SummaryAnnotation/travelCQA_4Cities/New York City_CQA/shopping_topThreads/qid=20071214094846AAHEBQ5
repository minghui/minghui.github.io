I am going to ENTITY_New_York_City tomorrow and my plane arrrives at ENTITY_La_Guardia at 9:00 am . The check in time at the Best Western we are stayign at is 3:00 pm . We only have 3 days in NYC , so I do n't want to waste half of a day carring around the luggage . Where can I put it ? Has anyone else run into a problem like this ?

Then there 's all the baloney you have to endure to get off the plane , walk to the baggage claim , wait for your luggage , etc. . Then it takes time to find transportation into the city . So it 'll probably be around 11:00 or so , assuming the hotel is in the city -LRB- and I sincerely hope it is -RRB- . If the hotel ca n't give you a room early -LRB- and I know from working at hotels that if a room is available , they 'll let you check in early -RRB- , they will almost certainly hold your bags for you while you explore the city .

When you arrive , go directly to the hotel . They may let you check in early if the room is available ; if not they 'll almost certainly let you leave your baggage . They may even let you check in early if the room is NOT available & let you come back for the key that evening . This happens all the time .

That way , you can come straight to the hotel after some sight seeing . While at the hotel , you could check with the front desk to see if early check in is possible . Enjoy the trip .

Then go to Times Square and get something to eat . It is the the best place to go for a few hours to see the most stuff . It 's not very `` in depth '' so it can be done rather easily , but its full of cool stores , great restaurants , and interesting people , so it 's a good way to blow off a few hours !

Sometimes , if the room is ready , they 'll let you check in to avoid the mad rush at 3pm . They probably wo n't guarantee it until you show up . While you have them on the phone , ask if they can store your bags until you can check in . Most hotels will do this .

Just be sure to tip them for holding it . Though I do n't know if you tip before or after as someone different could be there later on .

Most hotels do n't have a problem with that as long as you give them enough notice -LRB- 24-48 hours -RRB- . If it 's not possible to check in early , nearly every hotel will hold your luggage for you in a secure area until your room is available .
