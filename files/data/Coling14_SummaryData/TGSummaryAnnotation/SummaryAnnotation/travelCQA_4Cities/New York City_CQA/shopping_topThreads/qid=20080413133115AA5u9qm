They are expensive , fancy , top quality restaurants and great service . Actually , I even got an inside look and got to help make some of the food at Craft . It 's really good . Look up the addresses . For shopping , all you have to do is walk down a street and you 're bound to see a great clothing store , like Gap , ENTITY_Abercrombie , ENTITY_H&M , etc. . Also visit the really famous places like ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty , ENTITY_Empire_State building etc. . Oh , and TOTALLY stay at the Waldorf Hotel , in the presidential suite . Its got 2 bedrooms , a huge living room and a bathroom like the size of a bedroom .

As for the shopping spree , it depends on what your taste is . 5th Ave. around midtown has a lot of major designers if that 's your thing . But personally , I like to shop at ENTITY_Macy_'s . It is huge and it 's very different from the ENTITY_Macy 's in your hometown . Also , ENTITY_Canal_Street and ENTITY_Chinatown are full of cute little knick-knacks for extremely cheap prices . Go to ENTITY_SoHo if you want to find like trendy hipster stuff . Some other things you can do are go to comedy shows . I know there are some you can go to at 16 , but usually you need an adult with you . Just call a few different places until you find one . The comedians in NY are the best in the world imho . Also , you might want to see a show on Broadway if possible . Some really fun ones are Legally Blonde , Wicked , and The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee -LRB- sooo funny -RRB- . For dinner , head down to ENTITY_Little_Italy and eat on Mulberry St. I love the food there , and it is a really cute neighborhood with a great atmosphere . Have fun !

The hat stands are especially cute with the knit caps and such . If you want to go to an actual store you should try to hit strawberry adn saks 5th ave. It has amazing stuff . Im sure you can get around , but you might want to do stuff other than shopping , because you can shop at home . Are you staying downtown or uptown ?

ENTITY_Century_21_Department_Store -LRB- Church and ENTITY_Cortlandt_Streets -RRB- and the Chinatown/Canal Street Area . I hope this information is very helpful . Good luck ENTITY_Native_New_Yorker
