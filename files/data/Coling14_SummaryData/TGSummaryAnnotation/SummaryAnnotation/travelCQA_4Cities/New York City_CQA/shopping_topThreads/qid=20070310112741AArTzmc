While we are there we are going to the Broadway play Wicked . Our teachers said that we have to dress formally . But I was wondering how formal we should dress . Like a long dress ? Or something like a skirt and a sweater ?

A long dress is way beyond reasonable . Sweater and skirt sounds good . Wear comfortable stuff -- particularly the shoes . You 'll probably be climbing several flights of stairs in the theater . NYC weather in early April can be extremely undependable . Some years ago we had a big snowfall on April 8 . But usually it is very nice . Back to the theater dressing -- native New Yorkers get away with much more informal wear than your teacher is likely to tolerate . A nice sweater and modest skirt should keep everyone happy . Just remember you will be sitting there for a couple hours , with only brief intermissions . Have fun . -LRB- Wicked is a prequel to Wizard of Oz , showing the witch 's life before ENTITY_Dorothy landed on her -- just a bit of advise to be prepared -RRB- .

You do n't want to wear clothing that is restricting - you 'll be in the same position for almost three hours - tight pants that cut into you are the last thing you need . -LRB- If your shoes bother you , you can slip them off in the dark -RRB- . You do n't have to dress for The ENTITY_Rainbow_Room , but torn jeans and a wife-beater shirt are not appropriate . I take a plastic bag to the theatre and put my jacket in it and put it under my seat - otherwise I 'd have to sit with it in my lap . Have a great time - `` Wicked '' is terrific .

If you are doing a lot of walking , you might be more comfortable in dress pants , a sweater , and comfortable shoes . As long as you are dressed neatly and not wearing ripped clothes with holes , and sneakers that are falling apart , you will be okay . Most people dress like they would if they were going to see a theatrical production -LRB- a play -RRB- at a college .

Some people get dressed up , some wear jeans . I would say , a skirt and sweater would be fine . You will be watching a play and be cramped up in pretty tight seating for a couple of hours.You want to be comfortable .
