You should definitely go to ENTITY_Jersey Gardens ! Its a massive indoor outlet mall ! There are loads of trendy designer stores & the prices are great ! Me & my girlfriend brought big suitcases with us & by the time we were half way round they were full !! Bring plenty of cash or a credit card with a good limit on it ! Devote a day to this place & get there early before all the crowds arrive . Also , bring your passport with you & go to the customer service counter to receive vouchers for a lot of the shops , like gap etc. . . Theres a big foodcourt to get your breakfast or lunch or whatever you need ! You can get a taxi but it may cost about 30 dollars or so or you can get the bus , details below . Also go to the ENTITY_Abercrombie_Store on 5th Avenue ! It has great clothes & great music !! I hope this helps !! ENTITY_Anthony_New_Jersey_Transit Bus # 111 and # 115 from ENTITY_New_York_Local public transportation is provided by ENTITY_NJ_Transit bus # 40 and ENTITY_Coach_USA bus # 24 .
