The only reason to go into the times square area is to see a Broadway play which is again a must . Just do n't hang around there all day see all parts of the city from Battery Park to ENTITY_Harlem it is not that big so you really can explore it in a relatively short period of time . Have fun stay safe !!

Make sure to visit the sights and you can find a restaurant for any type of food in NY city . There are good places and bad , as with most major cities , it depends on where you are staying . People in NY are gruff but can also be very helpful . . Yes , it does get cold in the winter , bring warm clothing . It is expensive to live in NY so bring lots of money . I have lived in NY all my life and I would never want to live anywhere else . It is all here , you just need to know where to find it .

As for what to bring ... as my mom always used to say , bring half as many clothes and twice as much money . Bring warm stuff for sure but most places you will be fine in jeans so you do n't need to bring your whole wardrobe . There is an amazing amount of stuff to do so start planning now -- do n't plan down to the minute but make a list of the things you absolutely want to see . Top of the Empire State Building ? Statue of ENTITY_Liberty ? Ground Zero ? It 's up to you . Some of the finest museums in the world , too . Personally I would give Times Square a miss , it has lost all of its character and it 's usually overrun with tourists but all the ecclectic shops are gone and everything is ENTITY_Disney and The Gap which you can see anywhere . Also keep your wits about you and remember you are in a big city . Dont flash your money or walk around with your face stuck in a map . Do n't carry big bags because there is nowhere to stow or `` check '' them and you wo n't want to be dragging them thru the city all day long . And avoid all the chain restaurants ! Try all sorts of new and exotic foods while you are here -- there is everything from ENTITY_Korean BBQ to Japanese Hibachi cooked on your table . Do n't waste your time eating at ENTITY_Disney !

There are tons of things to do and visit . February is cold but since you are from the ENTITY_UK you might not find extraordinarely colder . There should be snow so bring snow boots , hats , gloves , scarves , etc. . . Besides the comum sights to see like Empire State bldg , Central park , 5th Avenue , ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty , museums , etc. . . You should definitely try to visit : - Ground zero - Ice skating at the Rockefeller Center or at Central park - If you and your colleagues are 21 and older , go out at the Meat Pack Distring , it is insane with tons of great clubs , lounges and restaurants - Walk in ENTITY_Soho , ENTITY_East_Village and ENTITY_West_Village - if you are 21 and older visit some sports bars . It is fan . - In February the ENTITY_Irish community celebrates ENTITY_St._Patricks day . If you are here , go see the parade . It is really nice - Visit ENTITY_Brooklyn - ENTITY_Seaport is a fun area specially for turists -LRB- has a very european feeling -RRB- . And you have great views of ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge . have fun

Another indoor hotspot is ENTITY_Chelsea 's Piers - located on along the ENTITY_Hudson_River in the 20 's . They host pretty mush every sport . A must do is check out the ENTITY_South_Street_Seaport , Central Park ice skating , ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center , shopping along Fifth Avenue , ENTITY_FAO 's on 5th and 57th . February is cold , so bring layers to dress in . There are days that are not freezing and you 'll want to peel off a layer or two . For more event info , check out Newyork.Citysearch.com . If you 're into the club scene , denim and boots will do with a nice shirt . They 'll have a coat check usually , so no need to worry about that . Have fun !
