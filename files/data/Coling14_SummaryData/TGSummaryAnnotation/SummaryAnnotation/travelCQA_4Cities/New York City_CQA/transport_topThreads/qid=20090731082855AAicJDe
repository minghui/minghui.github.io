So on expedia who I 've booked my trip through , they have a shuttle and for 16 bucks a person , will take us from the airport -LRB- ENTITY_LaGuardia -RRB- to our hotel in ENTITY_Manhattan , and that includes bag assistance , taxes , tolls . Do you think this is a better deal then getting a taxi ? How much would a taxi cost about that far ? Do they charge by the minute or mileage ? This is my first time going and we do n't want to hastle with public buses and subways with our luggage . What do you think ? Is the 32 for both of us better than what a taxi would charge ?
qid=20090731082855AAicJDe_answer_1	1	qid=20090731082855AAicJDe	2009-07-31 16:09:45 +0000	best_answer	 You 'd probably pay about the same for a cab , and you 're right that for a first time , it 's probably better to go with minimum hassle . You might do better and as the other answers said you could do a lot better if you 're willing to deal with public transportation -LRB- which is pretty easy -RRB- . That sounds like a decent deal with all the assistance and tolls . For a first-timer in a strange city , I 'd say go for it . Maybe experiment with other modes on the way back . ENTITY_FYI , taxis charge by both time and mileage , so if you take a cab in ENTITY_Manhattan you can end up running up some charges in heavy traffic . Even so , ENTITY_New_York cabbies are good at squeezing through little holes and getting around traffic jams , and most rides I 've taken are $ 10 or less . It 's often a better deal than subway for a group of 3 or 4 .

But if you take the taxi you may save around 10 to 15 dollars again depending on which part but it is not worth it if you are in the city for the first time . The taxi charges on mileage and on traffic lights by minutes .

If your taxi meets in traffic , your meter will keep going .

A cab from ENTITY_Laguardia to midtown , if there 's not much traffic , will probably run about the same as the bus -LRB- which is the best way to go , and the cheapest -RRB- - * IF * the driver goes directly from the airport to the hotel . But they 've been known to take the scenic route if they 're in no hurry to get back on the taxi line at the airport . Rather than cruising around , burning THEIR gas looking for a fare , they can cruise YOU around , burning YOUR gas , and getting your money . The bus is safe , as fast as the shuttle and cheaper . Just ask at any Transportation desk inside the terminal - they can give you all the options , including approximate taxi fares . -LRB- They 're airport employees , so they do n't care what you do - they wo n't set you up with their brother-in-law for a kickback . -RRB-
