Minimum , more if the traffic is slow . Then .40 every minute that traffic is moving less than 12mph , which is mostly of the time during the day in ENTITY_Manhattan . Plus a $ 1.50 surcharge 4-8 in the afternoon , reduced to .50 after that . Rent a car ? even more than that . Parking is rare and expensive . You could easily spend $ 100 if you drive around and repark a couple of times as well as park overnight . Buy an ENTITY_MTA_Unlimited_Use_Metrocard . $ 27 will give one person unlimited use of buses and subways for seven days . The subways go everywhere that you want to go . Sure you may have to walk a couple of blocks on either end , but then you will see stuff . ENTITY_New_York stuff . Is n't that why you are coming here . My advice about using the subway is to get a map from a station agent . You could print one from mta.info as well and probably should . Then figure out the way of least transfers . If walking three blocks means taking one train instead of two , do it .

Taxis are expensive but dont forget you can take a train / bus everywhere for 2.50 each entry http://www.mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm

So you can pay for parking , and not move it , cause you 'd lose your good spot ? Take the subway and the buses , use cabs like buses , take them from where you are , to the corner nearest where you 're going . Yeah , cabs are expensive . That 's why most New Yorkers travel by foot , or use the subway/bus .

You just have to ride the subway car where you see lot of people within decent hours that 's all .

It is expensive , it is difficult to not only navigate , but just DRIVE in ENTITY_Manhattan . Plus , you 'll have to pay to park everywhere , even your hotel . That is , if you can find a spot . And I guarantee , in a week , you 'll get at least 2 parking tickets . Subway is cheapest way to get around . Buy a one week metro pass . THe only downsides to this is ... if it 's your first time in NYC , you may waste a lot of time getting lost and going the wrong way on the Subways . Plus , because they 're underground , you 'll miss a lot of the cool sight-seeing . My best advice is to walk as much as you can . Take a cab when you can afford it and use the Subway for all the other times . Have fun !

You can walk about anywhere easily enough too . ENTITY_Manhattan is actually not that big . It is just `` tall '' lol . If you bring your laptop , you can check hopstop.com and put in your start and destination . It will give you the best way to get anywhere in the city and offer alternate routes using a choice of walking , bus , subway and even the cost a taxi would be to get from A to B. Do n't bring a car . Parking is next to impossible and very costly . There are also time limits on meters that only allow you an hour to stay even if you wish to pay more for additional time . Buy a weekly metrocard for you and your g/f for unlimited rides on the bus and subway . That is your best bet .
