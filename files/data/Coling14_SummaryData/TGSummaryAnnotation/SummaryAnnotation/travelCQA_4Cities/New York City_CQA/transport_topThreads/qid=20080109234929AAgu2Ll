Check with the parking sign to see what time of the day the street sweeper passes by your street and move you car the night before . If you do n't , expect a fine that will hurt you wallet for about a week . Good Luck

However , it will cost you thousands of dollars a year to reserve a spot in a garage , and there may not even be one very close to home . Talk to people in your particular part of ENTITY_Sunnyside about how they handle this . And are you sure you ca n't get to school by public transportation -LRB- either subway or bus -RRB- ? A car is a very expensive thing , and if you 're a college student , you should n't really be clinging to expensive things .

I live in ENTITY_Brooklyn , and I park on the street , though it is hard to find a parking place . Also , you have to keep moving your car for alternate side of the street parking . Do you know how that works ? The streets have signs saying something like `` no parking Monday and Thursday , 8 - 11 am '' and then the other side of the street will say `` no parking Tuesday and Friday , 8 - 11 am . '' So , unless you are taking your car out every day , you will be moving your car from side to side most days of the week . And looking for a parking space while you do it ! ALSO , your car will get dinged , bumped , dented and scraped from time to time . Get used to that ! If you do n't need a car in NYC , do n't have one . I need one for work , but I take it with me every day , so I do n't have to worry about alternate side . But if I did n't need it for work , I would n't have one . Good luck !

Since it 's a residential street in ENTITY_Sunnyside , there is likely 2 hours once or twice a week you ca n't park on that side of the street for street cleaning . Just park on the other side , double park if necessary , you wo n't get a ticket as long as you move it back after street cleaning time us up .
