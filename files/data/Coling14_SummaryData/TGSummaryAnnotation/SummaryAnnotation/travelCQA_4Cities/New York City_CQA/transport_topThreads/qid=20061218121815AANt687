Parking is $ 9 daily . Ferry is $ 6 each way per person to midtown -LRB- less than a 10min ride -RRB- . Once you arrive in midtown , you can catch a free shuttle bus -LRB- available in front of terminal -RRB- . The shuttle buses can take you to Times Square , Theatre District , ENTITY_Chelsea_Piers , the Village ... just about anywhere in ENTITY_NYC . This is the ENTITY_safest_&_easiest way to get to NYC - and you beat the crowds & traffic !

You do n't say where you are coming in from . If from ENTITY_Long_Island , I would park in ENTITY_Flushing and take the # 7 subway in . If from ENTITY_New_Jersey , park in ENTITY_Hoboken or ENTITY_Jersey_City and take the PATH train in , or drive into ENTITY_Staten_Island and take the ferry over . From the north , park in the ENTITY_Bronx and take the subway down , or drive all the way into the upper tip of ENTITY_Manhattan , park and take the A train from its first stop .
