If you are staying in NJ where the hotels will be cheaper than ENTITY_Manhattan , it 's good to use . For $ 15 dollars and 45 minutes , two trains will take you from ENTITY_JFK into NYC and for an additional $ 3 dolars , you can grab an airport shuttle . Taxi are flat rate of $ 45 plus tolls and tips . Cabs tend to be cheaper out of ENTITY_LGA plus it has easy access to the buses and shuttle as well . It all depends on your hotel . On your hotel 's site , the may list which airport they are close to and if they provide free shuttle service . Check it out so you do not spend more then you should .

You will find a slight difference in travel options to the city , and pricing of those travel options . But you will be able to find your way no matter which you pick . 1 . ENTITY_LaGuardia -LRB- ENTITY_LGA -RRB- : Cheapest cab ride , and probably closest to the city . You also have a public transportation option : the M16 bus . 2 . ENTITY_JFK : Cab ride is more expensive , and it 's further from the city . You can take a rather long subway ride to the city , though . Just take the AirTrain to the subway . 3 . ENTITY_Newark -LRB- EWR -RRB- : cab ride is most expensive , and you have to pay more tolls . You have to take a Jersey cab which I do n't like as much as the ENTITY_NYC cabs . However , public transportation is easiest here - you can take NJTransit . For each , you can always look into shuttle buses like ENTITY_SuperShuttle or the express buses from ENTITY_JFK and ENTITY_LGA . Safe travels !

We have taken the subway ENTITY_&_Air train to & from one time & it really is n't that long of a trip . Before you know it you 're there & it cost $ 7 vs. $ 60 . -LRB- just not recommended if you have alot of bags to maneuver -RRB- Just do some research & plan ahead with enough time to get to the ENTITY_AP_& you 'll be fine !! Enjoy NY !!!

ENTITY_Laguardai has the least flights but is closest to the city . You also have no train option into the city . ENTITY_JFK is the most difficult to navigate due to its size . ENTITY_JFK also has flat rate taxis into ENTITY_Manhattan .
