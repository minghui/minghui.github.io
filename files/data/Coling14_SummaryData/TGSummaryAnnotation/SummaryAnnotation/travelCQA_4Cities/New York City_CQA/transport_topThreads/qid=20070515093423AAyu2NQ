Lots of companies can arrange to have you met when you come in to your arrival airport . You can use some of the cash you would have spent on the parking lot for your car toward the cabs .

First drive around the area to see what the alternate side of the street parking is like . In that area the cars only have to be moved one day a week , so depending on what day you are leaving and returning , you can park on the street and not have to move it for a full 6 days . Then walk or spend about $ 5 for a cab to ENTITY_LaGuardia and then catch the $ 12 shuttle bus between airports . If you catch a cab , with all of the road work being done over by ENTITY_JFK , it will cost you upwards of $ 30 - $ 40 just for the cab .

Once you 've reached ENTITY_Jackson_Heights get on the E train heading Uptown/Jamaica Center get off at ENTITY_Sutphin Blvd-Archer Ave and then take the ENTITY_JFK_Airtrain to ENTITY_JFK .
