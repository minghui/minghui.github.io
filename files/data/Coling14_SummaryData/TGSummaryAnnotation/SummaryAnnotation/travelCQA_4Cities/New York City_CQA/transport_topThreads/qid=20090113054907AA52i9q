We would like to drive there so we would like to stay in ENTITY_New_Jersey -LRB- save for the driving in ENTITY_Manhatten and parking -RRB- where is the closest , yet safe , place to stay in ENTITY_New_Jersey that is easibly commutable each day -LRB- no i do n't mind dealing with commuter traffic on trains etc. . How much is the train going to cost each day ? Are there places that are cheaper to commute from than others ?

The PATH runs very frequently . It does n't take very long at all . During the week from 6 am to 11 pm , the train to Newport/Pavonia station in ENTITY_Jersey_City runs directly -LRB- not stopping in ENTITY_Hoboken -RRB- every 5-10 minutes . The trip takes about 15 minutes . After 11 pm and on weekends , it is still quite convenient but takes a little longer because it stops in ENTITY_Hoboken first . The ENTITY_Marriott and ENTITY_Doubletree are both excellent .

ENTITY_Jersey_City is expensive to park in too . Also remember that it can take you an hour each way to commute into the city even if you are close -LRB- the trains and buses do not run as often during the non rush hours -RRB- , and even the cheapest way will cost you $ 4 round trip/person . With all of the said , it really depends on how often you are going to go into the city -LRB- just once a day , spend all day there , and then go home for the night -RRB- . When it comes down to it , it is not really worth it . Just pay and stay in the city . You will be happy when you are tired from walking around , need to take a break , and you can go to your romm and sit for a bit -LRB- and drop off any things you purchased -RRB-

It just a train stop away -LRB- using the PATH Trains , which is cheaper than the ENTITY_MTA -RRB- . There are plenty of hotels there , and a mall just walking distance away . I highly recommend it .
