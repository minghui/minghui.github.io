There might be a rush hour as people board shuttles back home You should get your boarding pass for your next flight before you leave the airport . Two suggestions : Take the local bus -LRB- $ 2.50 in coins each way , or get a $ 5.00 MetroCard -RRB- to the # 7 subway near ENTITY_Roosevelt_Avenue . Keep track of how long the bus takes . You can then wander around this very diverse neighborhood , enjoying a `` typical '' slice of ENTITY_New_York . Buy a big lunch for a cheap price -LRB- compared to terminal food -RRB- to keep from starving on the way home ! Second option : Take the # 7 train -LRB- $ 2.50 , or a free transfer with MetroCard -RRB- to ENTITY_Shea_Stadium . There 's ENTITY_CitiField , where the ENTITY_Mets play , the U.S. Open Tennis Center , and ENTITY_Flushing_Meadows , as recently seen in Iron Man 2 . Catch the subway back before Six , you 'll need to connect back to the bus to the airport . Otherwise , hail a taxi at Roosevelt Avenue ... it should cost less than $ 10 to get to ENTITY_LGA . -LRB- Yellow Cab , or a limousine taxi ... look for the `` T '' on the license plate and ask how much the fare will be before getting in . -RRB- Plan this all out on ENTITY_Google_Maps . MTA.info will have maps and information under the `` ENTITY_New_York_City Transit '' tag . Personally , I suggest you stay near Roosevelt Avenue . There 's enough around there there to see and enjoy , and if time gets short , it 's easy to get back to the airport .

And then again , your 4:04 lands at that time . By the time you 're off the plane and find transportation , more time has gone by . So , it does n't seem like you really have time . Of course , you could hire a cab , and ask him to give you a tour for an hour and a half . That would cost a fortune .

Take a cab to ENTITY_Astoria . A mostly ENTITY_Greek neighborhood not far from the airport . -LRB- 15 -20 mins by cab -RRB- Eat a Gyro or Slouvlaki at `` Pinnochio 's '' . 31 st / 30th av . Do the cafe thing at ENTITY_Kolonaki 's and its rival ENTITY_Omonia -LRB- same block -RRB- . Taxi to ENTITY_Astoria_Park -LRB- North and west -RRB- for a postcard view of ENTITY_Manhattan . -LRB- Not far , just too far to walk.5-10 mins by cab -RRB-

I would check on this first before you start investigating places to visit and then feel unhappy as you ca n't visit them .

And ENTITY_LGA is in ENTITY_Queens , which means there is not much to see there . So by the time you drive anywhere which takes forever it would n't be worth it .
