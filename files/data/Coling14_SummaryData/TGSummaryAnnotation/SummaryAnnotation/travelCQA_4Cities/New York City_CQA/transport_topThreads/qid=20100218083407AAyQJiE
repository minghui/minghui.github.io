Some garage 's offer you a flat discounted rate if you leave the car there for the day -LRB- at least 8hrs -RRB- and let them know beforehand . . do n't park to close to any major attraction -LRB- Empire State Building for example -RRB- cause parking will be more expensive -LRB- Obviously -RRB- You could also try your luck with street parking , but your chances are slim . Since most spots are either permit only , or have a meter on it with a 1 to 2 hour maximum .

I 'm not sure where you are basing your shopping and sight seeing . Theres a lot on the upper east side ... museums and things , so I suggest you park anywhere from 50-90 on the east side ... side streets . You will have to circle and circle for a while maybe 1 hour ! But you might get lucky ! You take the bus for things close by and subways for things that are farther away . The thing with the bus is that it stops every 2 blocks ... and that does n't include the red lights ! LOL You do n't need to buy ahead of time , you show up and theres a machine to buy subway cards -LRB- that also work on the buses 2 -RRB-

You buy what 's called a metro card , fill it with any dollar amount -LRB- rides are $ 2.25 apiece for subway or bus , or you can get an unlimited day pass for I believe $ 9 -RRB- and use the subways or buses

The traffic is crazy , and you will spend most of your time looking for a place to park . Park your car when you get there -LRB- expect to pay around $ 50 per day -RRB- , and take the subway .

That means you will take either : Commuter rail A bus A subway like train called the PATH This depends on where you park -LRB- in ENTITY_Westchester or ENTITY_New_Jersey . -RRB- However , I strongly suggest finding a hotel IN the ENTITY_City . Getting in and out of the ENTITY_City is a hassle . There is bigger difference between NYC and it 's suburbs than any other city in the ENTITY_U.S. . Once you are in the City , you will most likely take subways , or the occasional City bus around town . It 's quite cheap - either buy a card by the day , week or month , or just put 46 dollars on a card and get extra rides on the card . If you buy in bulk , rather than by the day , week or month , you can share the card between several people . The time limited cards are great if you will travel a lot in that given space of time , but they can only be used by one person .
