I believe that you 're looking at $ 40 or more per 24 hour period . It might help if you say , at least in general terms , where you 'll be staying ... a hotel in midtown ENTITY_Manhattan , with friends in ENTITY_Brooklyn , etc. . UPDATE There are places in ENTITY_New_Jersey where you can park for about $ 10 per 24 hour period , and take the commuter train into ENTITY_Manhattan . One place I know of is the Metropark train station just off Exit 131 of the ENTITY_Garden_State_Parkway . From there you take the ENTITY_New_Jersey_Transit commuter train to ENTITY_Newark , where you change to the PATH train to the World Trade Center station in lower Manhatthan . I believe you 'd pay about $ 20 round trip in train fares to do so .

My advice , consider parking outside the city and come into the city by commuter rail . If you 're coming from ENTITY_New_England or ENTITY_Upstate_NY , you can park you car at one of the many ENTITY_Metro-North train station parking garages for a very reasonable rate . The list show are a few train station in the system that have very good parking facilities . New Haven Line ----------------------- New Haven-Union Station ENTITY_Bridgeport_Stamford_New_Rochelle_Hudson_Line ------------------ ENTITY_Poughkeepsie_Croton_Harmon_From any of these stations you can take Metro-North to Grand Central Terminal and then transfer to the ENTITY_New_York_City subway for the rest of the trip to ENTITY_Lower_Manhattan . The # 4 and 5 subway lines -LRB- ENTITY_Green_Line on the subway map -RRB- will take from ENTITY_Grand_Central to ENTITY_Fulton_Street , which is the heart of ENTITY_Lower_Manhattan . http://mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm -LRB- printable subway map -- click on the ENTITY_PDF icon to enlarge and print -RRB- If you 're coming from points west and south , you can parking your car in either ENTITY_Jersey_City or ENTITY_Hoboken , ENTITY_NJ and take the PATH train into NYC . The links below show the location of parking garages in both cities , may of which are near PATH train stations . Grove Street Station http://maps.google.com/maps?near=Grove+Sâ€?Exchange Place Station http://maps.google.com/maps?near=Exchangâ€?Pavonia/Newport Station http://maps.google.com/maps?near=Pavoniaâ€?Hoboken Station http://maps.google.com/maps?near=Hobokenâ€?Journal Square http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/paâ€?Please note that parking rates varies from garage to garage .

'' Essentially there is no free parking in ENTITY_Manhattan except in the evenings and then you might not find any and you have to be sure it 's not parked in an area during street cleaning time -LRB- signs will tell you , `` no parking between 2 am-6 am Thursdays '' for example -RRB- . If you are staying in a hotel , parking might be avail -LRB- for a fee -RRB- . Or just ask a parking garage what their rates are . Most likely , they will require you to leave your key so NO valuables in your car -LRB- including spare change which many attendants will steal -RRB- .
