My friends and will be visiting Times Square for New Years in a few weeks . We are planning on being downtown by noon and getting to Times Square around 5 pm . My question is where would be the best place to park ? We were thinking about possibly parking north of town and taking a subway . Are there any suggestions about where parking would be affordable for most of the day until well after midnight ? Having never been to ENTITY_NYC before , are subway prices realistically affordable for cheap college kids like myself ? Also , on New Years would every stop near Times Square be open before and after the festivities are over ? Thanks in advance !

You ca n't even drive into ENTITY_Manhattan on New Year 's Eve . My advice is leave the car outside the city -LRB- i.e. the suburbs -RRB- and take the train into the city . If you 're in the Northern or Northeastern suburbs park your car at any Metro-North Park and Ride station and take the train in to the city . If you 're on ENTITY_Long_Island park your car at any ENTITY_LIRR Park and Ride station and take the train in to the city . If you 're in ENTITY_New_Jersey park your car at any ENTITY_NJ_Transit_Park and Ride station and take the train in to the city . Once in the city you can take the subway , the fare is $ 2 per person , per ride or you can get a 1 day pass for $ 7 -LRB- one card per person please -RRB- and you will have unlimited ride on the subway and bus network . However on New Year 's Eve is best to take the subway instade . As for the subway being open at midnight , that 's a big yes . All station near Times Square will be opened , and if possible entrance will be free -LRB- I know ENTITY_City_Transit did it last year , however I do n't know if they going to do this year -RRB- . One more thing , under any circanstanses , do not , I repeat DON NOT , bring bags , or alchol to the festivities , the cops here will confiscate them and , I a sure you , you will not get it back . Also dress warm , at times it can get do to the 20s . And once you find a spot to see the ball , stay there , because once you live you spot , someone will take it from . Take my advice and you will have a nice , and happy , new year 's . ENTITY_Native_New_Yorker .

So arrive early & park at one of the lots on the ENTITY_Lower_East_side_& take the train up to Times Sq. . Then you can walk or train down later ; get totally pissed & your designated driver can retrieve the car early New Years morning & drive home . Subway fare is $ 2.00 .
