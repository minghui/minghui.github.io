If you go into Grand Central either walk in or ride in from another train you will see signs that will guide you to the `` subway '' . The subway runs through ENTITY_Manhattan and the NY boroughs . Find a subway map and look to find Central park . A big green patch in the middle of ENTITY_NY_City . Then Choose which side of the park you want to end up on . I personally like the side that the ENTITY_NY_Metropolitan_Museum is on and the R train takes you there .

However , there are subway trains that can take you from ENTITY_GCS to CP . Go to the ENTITY_MTA website for complete info about routes . Central Park is huge , so you 'll have to figure out what part of CP you want to go to and plan your route accordingly . Some trains go to CPW and some to Fifth Avenue .
