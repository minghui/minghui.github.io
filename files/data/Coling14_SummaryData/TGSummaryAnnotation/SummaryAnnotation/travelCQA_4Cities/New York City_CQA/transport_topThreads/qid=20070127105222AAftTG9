qid=20070127105222AAftTG9_answer_1	1	qid=20070127105222AAftTG9	2007-01-28 02:23:59 +0000	best_answer	 Unless you plan to drive around ENTITY_New_Jersey , do n't rent a car - parking is extremely expensive and driving around midtown is a nightmare . It would be much cheaper to use public transportation . I wonder , how much money are you saving by staying in ENTITY_New_Jersey ? There are affordable places in ENTITY_Manhattan . If you stay in ENTITY_Jersey , you ca n't go back to drop off packages , take a shower , rest , change clothes . Once you leave ENTITY_New_Jersey , you will probably stay in ENTITY_Manhattan for the rest of the day . Also , factor in the cost of your transportation into ENTITY_Manhattan for six people . So , unless you are visiting family in ENTITY_New_Jersey , maybe you 'll rethink your lodgings . You can get very good deals at decent hotels via ENTITY_Orbitz , ENTITY_PriceLine , etc. .

If you have path train access , do n't bother , but if you are a ways away from there , you may need to rent a car to get around NJ . You do n't want to take a car into the ENTITY_City . It is a pain , parking costs an arm and a leg , and driving in the city is annoying ... stop go , stop go , stop go ... I get out and take the train ! If you update where you are going to be staying , I could give you a better idea of what you will need to do .

qid=20070127105222AAftTG9_answer_8	2	qid=20070127105222AAftTG9	2007-01-27 19:05:15 +0000	answer	 I suggest you do n't rent a car . Traffic is extremely congested . Parking is scarce and at a premium . You might be able to take a shuttle from the hotel to the subway station just after the tunnel . Then you can ask the subway clerk what connections to make in order to get to your destination in NYC . Then you can walk to wherever you want to go . And it is the best way to see NYC .

You will save neither time nor money The fastest and cheapest way around ENTITY_Manhattan is by subway . They offer a 1 day Fun Pass for $ 7.00 call 800 MetroCard for more info . www.mta.ny.nyc.us I assume that you guys are flying into ENTITY_Newark and staying at a hotel close by . have fun

If you ever drove in any big metro in ENTITY_USA , you can drive in NYC.No biggie . For 6 people , ENTITY_NJ , and NYC transportation will be way too much compared to car rental and even the parking meters etc. I live here , and used to drive a yellow cab , and a limousine in NYC . But again , think about the stress etc. . Is it worth all the trouble ? If you have '' GREEN '' why bother ?
qid=20070127105222AAftTG9_answer_12	2	qid=20070127105222AAftTG9	2007-01-28 03:23:29 +0000	answer	 It depends where in NJ your staying , and how close to a train station you are . First rule about driving in NYC , do n't if you do n't have to . The train is your best friend . What you should do is check out the train ticket prices online to see what it would come out to for round trip tickets , and compare it to the price of a rental car , and use your judgement based on that , plus parking at the train station . Parking in ENTITY_NYC can run up and beyond $ 20 a day , plus the price of the inbound toll on the tunnels and bridges .

Almost anywhere in ENTITY_New_Jersey you 'll be close to some sort of transit station -LRB- most likely a ENTITY_NJ_Transit commuter train station -RRB- . A lot of hotels have shuttles that will take you there . You may also be able to walk or take a bus there . Check the address and the ENTITY_NJ_Transit or PATH websites to find out . Once you 're at an ENTITY_NJ_Transit or PATH station , it 's a short ride into the city .
