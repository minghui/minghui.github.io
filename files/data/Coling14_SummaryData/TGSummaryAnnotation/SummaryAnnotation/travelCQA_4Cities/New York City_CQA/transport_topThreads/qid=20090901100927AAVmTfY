You would have to park in a parking garage and pay a good amount of money to park in them . Plus , ENTITY_Manhattan always has bad traffic near the tourists attractions . I suggest that if you want to drive , you should park somewhere , and go to the tourists attractions by walking or taking public transportation . Besides , if you drive by them , you wo n't be able too appreciate them as much .

You want to battle with the worst traffic in the nation and fight for parking space in ENTITY_New_York_City , specially in ENTITY_Manhattan . ENTITY_Real_New_Yorker take public transit , which is the best and cheapest way to go . The fare on the subway is just $ 2.25 per ride . However , since you 're in town for 3 days , you can purchase a 1-day unlimited ride MetroCard for $ 8.25 a day -LRB- $ 24.75 for 3 days -RRB- . With the 1-day unlimited ride MetroCard , you will be able to travel anywhere in the City for just one fare . Good luck

When I lived in NYC I did n't own a car and when I moved to ENTITY_Long_Island I avoided driving into ENTITY_Manhattan at all costs . Parking is too difficult , traffic is awful , and if you do n't know where you 're going the one-way streets will drive you nuts . Just get on one of those double-decker sightseeing busses , they take you everywhere .

You simply will not be able to do this . If you must bring your car , be prepared to park it somewhere and to LEAVE it for the entire time you are here . -LRB- And be prepared to pay a LOT for doing that , too . -RRB- In NYC , you will want to get around as New Yorkers do . We take the subway most of the time , and cabs when we can afford to -LRB- and when it 's really more convenient . Most of the time , the subway is the most convenient way to get around . -RRB- And , also , we walk and walk and walk EVERYWHERE ! It 's actually a good way to get around . Once you are here , you 'll see the pleasure of getting around this way .
