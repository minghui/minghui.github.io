Go in and have a few pints . There is also a great pizza place on that block i cant remember the name of it but you cant miss it . The train station is connected to the airport so you are very close to your terminal but far enough away that you are not in the airport . Thats what i would do .

Why ? Because the airports are in very remote areas of the city , with nothing to do anywhere around them at all , and , if you leave the airport , you 'll have to go back through security screening to get back in , and in ENTITY_New_York_City it 's SO crowded that , depending on the time of day , that could take hours ! So , just hang out in the airport , have a snack , stretch your legs , go windowshopping , but stay put ! ...

I would stay in the airport and not got far . ENTITY_NY is experiencing bad weather and flights coming have may have to change . By the way , occasionally check `` departure screen '' while you wait . On a return trip a few years ago , I had my departure gate change on me while I went to get a bite to eat . Due to the Airport noise , I missed the notice but fortunate for me I was passing by the screen on m way back and stopped just to double check .

However , if you are coming into any of the area airports : ENTITY_Newark , ENTITY_LaGuardia or ENTITY_JFK - STAY PUT !! You may not make it back in time to make your flight since there is no rhyme or reason to ENTITY_NYC traffic . You ca n't even be 100 % sure the subways will be working and on-time .
