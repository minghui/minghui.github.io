It may be a little pricey , but it should be safer than parking on the street . Its well worth it . Just remember which garage you parked in because at night they all seem to look alike . Have fun !

If you want cheaper garage parking try west of 9 Ave and walk to theater the farther west you go the cheaper the parking will be or on the street if you do n't -- parking rules are different on weekends and there are more spaces . Be careful to read all signs and make sure you can park for more than one hour , etc. . It might take a while driving around before you find a space . Parking at the Airport is a ridiculous idea it would be just as twice as expensive as a garage with the cab and you would be too far away from ENTITY_Manhattan .

The theater district is one of the areas where illegally parked cars are not only ticketed , they are towed away . Getting it back is a prime hassle , and will cost at least $ 205 after paying the ticket , towing fee , parking fee , etc. . You do n't say what direction you are coming from . If the north , park near the 242 Street and Broadway station of the ENTITY_IRT and take it downtown . If from ENTITY_Jersey , park in ENTITY_Jersey_City or ENTITY_Hoboken and take the PATH . If from ENTITY_Long_Island , park in ENTITY_Flushing and take the subway in . Much cheaper than the parking garages , less hassle .

OR there are plenty of garages in the area & their rates are generally comparable . Considering the price you 're probably paying for tickets , the parking charge is not that much more .
qid=20061114173053AAI7A9K_answer_10	2	qid=20061114173053AAI7A9K	2006-11-15 18:04:56 +0000	answer	 If you 're willing to pay a lot , there are commercial garages near Broadway . If you do n't mind some walking , you may find a free parking space within a block or two of the theater . Both of these options are somewhat risky for your car . Having grown up in ENTITY_Brooklyn , I would park in ENTITY_Brooklyn , ENTITY_Queens , or ENTITY_New_Jersey and ride mass transit to Broadway .
