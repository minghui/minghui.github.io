I currently do n't have a car and my friends and family say that I should get one . Although I do n't want to get a car because In NY there is transportation everywhere . If I do n't get a car I also do n't have to worry about car payments and car maintenance . Therefore I will save more money and be able to pay off college easier . So is a car really necessary ? My family also lives about 5 hours away . I see why I should get a car , so that I can come visit . But if I do get one I wo n't be using it very often .

With insurance , parking and maintenance , tolls , registration , etc , it will be tough to keep plus keeping up your tuition . Wait until you are 25 -LRB- where the insurance is cheaper -RRB- or until you are done with school . By then , you will be so use to mass transit , you will see you will not need it at all . Good luck with the studies .

If you are in ENTITY_New_York_State and planning to stay on campus , the need for a car is little more useful for any course work outside the campus and depending where you are traveling to another city or in case your destination is more than walking distance within the same city of your campus which there is no bus or shuttle bus is in the area . You say your family is 5 hours away , you can share a ride back home during the holidays and when semester is over or you can reach there by Greyhound if necessary .

It is not worth it and you can get by with public transportation . All your classroom buildings should be within walking distance of your dorm . You can take the train or bus to your parents ' town and they can pick you up at the station . It does n't cost that much .

In fact if you are living on campus the college probably does n't even offer you any place to park a car . Parking fees in NYC are outrageously expensive . It probably cost you more to park your car than it would to rent one when you need it . There is no reason to buy a car just for the convenience of driving home two or three times a year . It 's not worth it .
