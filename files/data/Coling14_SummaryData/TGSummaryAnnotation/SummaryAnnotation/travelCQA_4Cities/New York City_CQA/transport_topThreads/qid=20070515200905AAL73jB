I 'll be driving to NYC on June 16 -LRB- Saturday -RRB- and staying until that Tuesday . My question is : Where is it legal to park in the city ? I have n't been able to find anything about parking in residential neighborhoods . My hotel is at 81st Street and Riverside Drive on the ENTITY_Upper_Westside , which seems to be primarily residential . Can I park for free on the street during the weekend , and then pay for a garage the other two days ? And I 've heard something about alternate side of the street parking during street cleaning - does this mean that I can park legally on the street all week , as long as I switch when necessary ? I am really confused and ca n't find any good websites to help , so if anyone knows that neighborhood 's parking rules , I 'll be really grateful . Thanks ! And please do n't tell me to leave the car at home - I 'm coming from ENTITY_DC and do n't want to take the train .

The trick will be getting a spot . If you get in early on a Saturday after all the people have left for their day trips to the country you should n't have to search for more than about 20 min . Once you get a spot on Saturday you will be good til either Monday or Tuesday Morning depending on what side of the street you park on . You just have to read the sign which could be a distance from the spot . It will read `` no parking Monday and Thursday 9:00 -10:30 '' or something to that effect . As long as you are n't there during that time you are fine . Obviously there are fire hydrants , bus lanes and other spots that are n't legal but otherwise you are okay . Now most people who park on the street with alternate side parking just pull out of their space and double `` stand '' on the other side til the street sweeper comes through and then pull back into a legal spot on the cleaned side and wait in their cars til the designated time and then leave . If a cop comes through you just go around the block and play like musical chairs and hope you get a spot back . If you have to do this , pick up the Times and get a bagel from H&H on Broadway and 80th -LRB- they are the best -RRB- and have breakfast in your car , its a New Yorker -LRB- with auto -RRB- tradition .

There is little street parking & we have what is called ENTITY_Alternate_Side_of_the_Street_Parking rules which is for street cleaning . Parking tickets here run $ 60 plus .

Try to get in early on saturday and you may not have to wait that long to find a spot and try toget one that you 're allowed to park on Monday too . Then just dont move you 're car until tuesday . DONT move your car on sunday afternoon , because after 5-7 pm or so you will wait 1-2 hours for a spot to open back up .

You ca n't drive around the city because of the gridlock , you ca n't find parking , and what parking you can find is really expensive . You are correct in that you can park on the street , but you need to move the car at times . The trick is to find the space to begin with ... that is next to impossible . Just because you can park on your street is no guarantee that you can find a spot .

In the long run it will be cheaper than spending your time moving the car around and risking parking tickets and possible towing . Not to mention possible vandalism and theft . Whenever I 've had business in the city I 've always stayed at the hotels in the ENTITY_NJ_Meadowlands and drove in for the day . The hotels were cheaper . And my parking was free as part of the hotel stay . Driving in the city is always a bad idea both money and time wise .
