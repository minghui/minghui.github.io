This link has `` airport partner hotels . '' http://www.internationalairportguide.comâ€?Just tell them you 'll be checking in late . They will have your credit card number and will hold your room for you .

For three people , take a yellow taxi from the airport to your hotel , flat fare of $ 45 to ENTITY_Manhattan plus bridge or tunnel toll , plus a 10 % tip unless the driver is a complete jerk . To get to any of the airport hotels you 'd have to take a shuttle van , so you might as well take the taxi ride , which will be fairly quick late at night , and go where you want to go .

You may have to take a taxi to the hotel from the airline terminal if you are arriving very late , but the distance is less than a mile .

Realistically there are very few flights that arrive at ENTITY_JFK after 1:00 AM and in NYC 1:00 AM is not considered to be late
