I would prefer to rely on subways and mass transportation , however does anyone have any experience with this ? Is it worth the headache of bringing a car there ?

Go onto NYC.Gov and do a search on `` Alternate Side of the Street Parking '' ENTITY_Basicly , every weekday , except Wednesday street parking is forbidden for a couple of hours so that the streets can be cleaned . This means , the night before you need to find a spot on the `` right '' side . I know people whose entire lives seem to revolve around alternate side of the street parking . They wo n't go somewhere if they have a `` good spot '' . Need to get home by a certain time so they can find a spot . Some people hire other to move their cars . Its almost a cult . IF POSSIBLE , LEAVE THE CAR HOME .

He says it 's so easy to get where you want , plus you knock out the expenses of car payments , car insurance , buying gas and anything else you may have to pay to do to a car .

I lived in ENTITY_jamaica and had a driveway and that was fine having my car . When I lived in ENTITY_williamsburg I parked it on the street and had to move it twice a week . But there was always a place on the other side . It was really easy . Nothing bad ever happened . However , when I lived in ENTITY_Astoria I had to move it twice a week and sometimes would spend up to an hour driving around looking for a place , and then would sometimes be blocks and blocks away from home . Obviously if you have enough money to keep it in a lot that is the best option . I still live in the city and have no car anymore . I calculated the price and have determined that its actually cheaper to rent cars then to pay for a garage or lot . The trains and buses get me everywhere i want to go anyway .
