It will be double that -LRB- maybe more -RRB- from 42nd street depending on how many people are in the city that day . To get ENTITY_Chinatown , catch the N/R/W / Q line -LRB- south east corner of the park -RRB- to canal street -LRB- the are faster ways , but they are a little more tricky and would only save you 5 minutes or so -RRB-

Not that far . i would say 35-40 min . walk from Time sqaure to Central park . However that is going from south to north . ENTITY_China town is all the way south of the island . You would need to take a cab or the subway . The subway is only $ 2 . you can take the 1,2,3 , or the A train . from ENTITY_Colubus circle which is right at the start of Central park

Central Park starts at 59th Street , from Fifth Avenue to Eighth . You could walk it in about twenty minutes , assuming you do n't stop to look at anything along the way . ENTITY_Chinatown , however , is well below any of the numbered streets . You need to take a subway or bus . For subways , the ENTITY_Lexington_Avenue line or the R train to Canal Street from the ENTITY_Central_Park area . From Times Square , take the shuttle to the ENTITY_Lexington_Avenue line .

If you take your time and peek at things along the way , A walk up Broadway will be about 20-30 Min . If you want to get to ENTITY_ChinaTown from there , do something different than the subway ... from ENTITY_Columbus_Circle -LRB- ENTITY_59th_Street_&_Broadway_& 8th Ave/Central Park West , The South West Corner of Central Park -RRB- Get on the M20 Bus Downtown for an intresting 25 Min Ride down Broadway & 7th Ave to Canal Street . -LRB- $ 2.00 -RRB- .

However , I would n't want to go from either all the way to ENTITY_China_Town . Times Square & Central park are roughly in the middle of ENTITY_Manhattan . ENTITY_China_Town is way down at the bottom . I highly recommend taking the subway .
