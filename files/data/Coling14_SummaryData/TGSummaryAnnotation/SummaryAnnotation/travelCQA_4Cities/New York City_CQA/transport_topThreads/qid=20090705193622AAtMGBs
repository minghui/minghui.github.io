However , there is no direct subway line to and from ENTITY_LGA , therefore you will need to a bus to the subway station and then take the subway . Here 's how to get from ENTITY_LGA to the address in question , which is located between Broadway and 8th Avenue . Step 1 : purchase a $ 4.50 pay per ride -LRB- regular -RRB- MetroCard from any Hudson News stand at the airport and take the Q33 bus from the Main Terminal to the 74th Street/Roosevelt Avenue subway station . If you 're coming from the ENTITY_Marine_Air_Terminal , please take the Q47 bus to the 74th Street/Roosevelt Avenue subway station . Step 2 : at the 74th Street/Roosevelt Avenue subway station , transfer to the `` E '' train -LRB- Blue Line on the subway map -RRB- . Take the Manhattan-bound -LRB- westbound -RRB- train from ENTITY_Roosevelt_Avenue to 50th Street . Step 3 : at 50th Street , exit the subway and walk 2 blocks south along 8th Avenue from the subway station to 48th Street . Turn left on 48th Street and walk a half blocks to the Best Western President Hotel . I hope this information is very helpful .

It might be more expensive but , it will be worth it because you will not be carrying suitcases around while changing busses or trains . You can save in other ways once you make to your destination by utilizing the subway , bus , and walking . NYC is a great city . Happy shopping and sightseeing ! One last thing taxi drivers will keep the change if you do n't ask for it back .
