Best option is to park at either the ENTITY_Poughkeepsie or ENTITY_Croton_Harmon train station . That way , you have the choice between ENTITY_Amtrak to ENTITY_Penn_Station or ENTITY_MetroNorth to Grand Central . Alternatives include ENTITY_Albany , ENTITY_Hudson or ENTITY_Rhinebeck and take ENTITY_Amtrak , or any other mid-Hudson commuter station to take ENTITY_MetroNorth .

From the ENTITY_Poughkeepsie , you can hop on ENTITY_Metro-North 's ENTITY_Hudson_Line to Grand Central . A round trip off-peak ticket on the commuter train will cost you $ 30 . On city , you can get around by subway . The fare on the subway is only $ 2.25 , however , if you 're going to be doing a lot of traveling across the city I would recommend purchase a weekly unlimited ride MetroCard for $ 29 , which is a huge money saver . I hope this information is very helpful . Good luck ENTITY_Native_New_Yorker

You can park your car at the train station garage for free on the weekends . It 's like ten dollars a day on the weekdays . Your car will be secure and safe there . It 's a direct shot from there to Grand Centeral -LRB- 1hr45min -RRB- . It 's the last stop on the ENTITY_Hudson line and affordable . From Poughkeepsie off Peak hours is near $ 15 one way . If you take Amtrack its going to cost you alot more money to get to ENTITY_Manhattan . The ENTITY_MTA is the way to go from ENTITY_Dutchess_County .
