qid=20070927060248AApjfBQ_answer_1	1	qid=20070927060248AApjfBQ	2007-09-27 14:12:07 +0000	best_answer	 The best way to get around ENTITY_Manhattan is to walk if it 's less than a mile - I use buses most of the time and only use the subway if the weather 's too bad to wait outside for the bus or I 'm going a long distance -LRB- the subway 's faster than the bus , but the time difference is n't that much for a short distance -RRB- . The bus ride is more pleasant , it 's outside so you can see something other than a dirty tunnel wall , you do n't have to climb up and down the subway stairs and do n't have to wait on a swealtering platform in the summer or be boxed in on a crowded platform . Both the subways and buses run all night long every day . Except for delays or very , very late at night , you rarely have to wait more than ten minutes for either one . I never take taxis - they are expensive , get stuck in traffic and many of the drivers are reckless . I will telephone a car service when necessary - I use one where I know most of the drivers drive safely . The subways and buses are safe and they are easy to navigate . If you have a problem , you can call the ENTITY_MTA at -LRB-718-RRB-?330-1234 - that number is manned by live personnel from about 6am to 10:30 pm and they will answer all your questions and give you detailed directions . Buy a MetroCard . Have a great time .

'' That , along with the buses , make up one of the best mass-transit systems in the world . They take you just about anywhere in the city , especially in ENTITY_Manhattan . It 's also inexpensive , at just $ 2 a ride . Furthermore , it 's fast and it 's clean . In my whole life living in ENTITY_New_York , I 've never found any need to take a taxi . They 're expensive and they get stuck in traffic .

It was my first time there and I was on a super tight budget . I used the Subway to get around ... it 's $ 7 for a `` fun pass '' you can use all day with free transfers on the bus . Otherwise , it 's $ 2 a pop on the subway . I was VERY surprised by the fact that you can walk to get mostly anywhere in ENTITY_Manhattan . I stayed at the ENTITY_Warwick hotel on W. 56th -LRB- I THINK -RRB- , and did n't realize EVERYTHING was so closeby . I walked to Times Square , Central Park , 5th Ave. etc. . The only time I used the subway was to get to ENTITY_Chinatown and to see the Statue of Liberty . Here 's a link to get directions for the Subway : http://www.hopstop.com/ it 's much easier than reading a map . And you wo n't stick out like a `` tourist '' either . lol Enjoy ... I am saving up to go back ! I LOVE NY ! stardust
