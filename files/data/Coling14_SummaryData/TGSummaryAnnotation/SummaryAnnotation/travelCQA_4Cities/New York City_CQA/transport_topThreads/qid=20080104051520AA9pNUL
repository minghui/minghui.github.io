I discovered a nice , clean , well-lit , friendly parking garage for about $ 24/day at the very southern tip of ENTITY_Manhattan by Battery Park bordered by ENTITY_West_Side_Highway , ENTITY_Rector_Street and ENTITY_Greenwich_Street . However , I found a GREAT internet site that 'll provide you with the best parking rates all over the city . Go to http://nyc.bestparking.com/ and plug in your desired location and days/times , and it 'll spit out the rates for all area garages !!
