But they are not run by the Hotel -LRB- s -RRB- . They are private bus companies that take you to a central point in ENTITY_Manhattan . After that , you must navigate your way to the hotel . That 's just not practical unless you 're very familiar with ENTITY_Manhattan . 2nd way is public bus service from ENTITY_JFK to subway station . Very cheap . Then subway to ENTITY_Manhattan . Then , in ENTITY_Manhattan , navigate your way to the hotel . Both methods will take about 4 hours , unless you get lost . Best method : Taxi from ENTITY_JFK to the hotel . Driver loads your luggage into taxi . Taxi is comfortable and smooth ride to ENTITY_Manhattan . If driver is talkative -LRB- most are -RRB- , he 'll be glad to answer any questions you might have about your visit -RRB- . Arrive at your Hotel . Door man helps you out of taxi . Takes care of your luggage . Cost of Ride from ENTITY_JFK to Hotel : apx $ 40.00 . Cheap . Approximate time elapsed from ENTITY_JFK ot hotel 30-45 minutes . Take the taxi . Start your visit on a good taxi ride . Have fun . Feel free to contact me via this website . I live in NYC and am full of helpful information . Good Luck .

My mom came to visit me in June , and it was $ 45 . A subway would probably be $ 15 , but it will take you over an hour to get into the city . I dont know about a shuttle bus .
