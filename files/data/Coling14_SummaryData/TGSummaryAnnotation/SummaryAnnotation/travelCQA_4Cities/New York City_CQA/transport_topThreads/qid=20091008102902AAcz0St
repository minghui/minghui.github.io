I am from ENTITY_Virginia and do n't know much about transit up in ENTITY_Jersey and ENTITY_New_York but we are going up in November for a mini vacation to ENTITY_Denville , ENTITY_NJ . We normally would take the bus in to ENTITY_Port_Authority . Well I just found out that the buses do n't run Sundays . I am a little afraid of actually driving into the city but will if i had to . Does anyone have any suggestion on how to get into the city ? And an approx cost ?

If so , you can take ENTITY_New_Jersey_Transit trains from ENTITY_Denville to ENTITY_Penn_Station in ENTITY_Manhattan . ENTITY_New_Jersey_Transit is the local commuter railroad , but it operates from ENTITY_Denville 7 days a week . The station is located in ENTITY_Denville and has pay parking lots available . You should call ENTITY_NJ_Transit to confirm that you can park there without a permit . For train schedules , go to www.njtransit.com ; choose `` train schedules '' on the left ; then choose `` ENTITY_Denville '' as your origin and `` ENTITY_New_York_Penn '' as your destination . Fares are going to be around $ 20 round trip for an adult -- maybe less . You will arrive at ENTITY_New_York_Penn_Station . From there , you can get on the subway or go outside and get cabs anywhere . Enjoy .

Your question was n't too clear . If you '' re going to ENTITY_NYC direct , I would simply recommend going to greyhound.com and select your trip . As long as there are no transfers involved , Greyhound is actually not that bad for shorter distance trips , such as yours . Once you 're in NYC , you can take a train to ENTITY_Denville like the other person said on here . The Bus Station in NYC -LRB- ENTITY_Port_Authority -RRB- is about 10 blocks walking distance from the main train station in NYC -LRB- which is called NY ENTITY_PENN station -RRB- . If you have any further questions , pleaae feel free to e-mail me .

You can take ENTITY_NJ_Transit_'s_Morris_&_Essex_Line from ENTITY_Denville to ENTITY_Penn_Station_New_York . The one way fare on the ENTITY_NJ_Transit commuter trains will cost you $ 11.25 -LRB- $ 22.50 round trip -RRB- . You can also take the ENTITY_Montclair-Booton_Line from ENTITY_Denville to the ENTITY_City . The fare is the same as on the ENTITY_Morris_&_Essex . Both line serve the station . Good luck

Not so at all ! Driving in ENTITY_New_York_City is NOT that bad at all , especially on a Sunday ! I do it ALL the time and have done so for YEARS , and I can not for the life of me understand why people make such a huge deal about it . Sure , it 's kinda congested , but , so what , you 're in a comfy car with a radio rather than stuck on some cramped , stinky bus or train with someone 's farty butt in your face , or their elbow stuck in your eye ! I would suggest that instead of shlepping around on buses and trains like some sort of refugee , you drive in , in comfort , and park your car in a handy nearby parking lot when you get here , and then use public transportation to get around within the city while you 're here . Then , when you 're ready to go home , you can get back into your car and drive out of town in comfort and style instead of dragging yourself onto yet more buses and trains just to get back to your car ! Ridiculous ! Good luck , and the link below is to a good webpage directory of Parking Garages In ENTITY_New_York_City ...
