I used to volunteer there and I loved it , its great but too many tourists and schoolkids . Museum of Sex I have been dying to go to . Now thats a great one , its really cool but if you want something more appropriate go to ENTITY_MOMA , The Museum of Modern Art . Its free and you donate how much you want -LRB- a penny , quarter etc -RRB- and the Artwork is great , I think ENTITY_Picasso has some stuff in there . The Guggenheim is wonderful though , I went a few years ago to see some work from ENTITY_Rosenquest . It was wonderful I wan na go back but I have to spend my funds on school . I have to work at the Intrepid Next week so if you guys are into military and aircrafts then that would be a great one but I think that you should stick with the art museums though , its wonderful work , makes great wallpapers but dont use flash photography and your girlfriend would think you were really caring of her to take her to the art museums . Trust me you will not be bored . You can actually go to all of them I recommend not going on weekends . Try going during 9am-2pm since all the kids are going to be in school and adults at work .
