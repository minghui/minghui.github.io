The traffic would be bad , but in NYC the `` dropping the ball '' would be very exciting . You could take her before if you are worried about traffic . If I could pick , I would want to go on New Years ! Go shopping , see ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty , go see the `` L O V E '' sign , go to the huge mall thing there with lots of candy and stores . I < 3 NYC !

For my sixteenth birthday my parents brought me and a few of my friends to see a Broadway show , and we did some shopping . It was a great time , and really exciting for me . Even if you just brought her , it 's still a great time . For a fifteen year old , Wicked and ENTITY_Mamma_Mia are the best shows on Broadway , they 're both amazing .

If she loves history take her to ENTITY_Ellis_Island , or the ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History . If she likes art , take her to the ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_art . I 've been to ENTITY_New_York a few times , and there is ALWAYS something to do . Sometimes it 's just fun to walk around and go to random places and shops and find stuff . Be sure to take her shopping though , cause there are some great shopping spots ! Good Luck and Have Fun ! : -RRB-

I personally would love to go to broadway , historical sites , and to a library . if she 's a city girl , she might like to just walk the streets , maybe texting . go before new years , and stay for new years , it 'll be tough getting in there at new years . ugh i shudder to think of getting on a plane that will arrive a couple days before new years ! =-RRB- good luck ! ~ fellow 14 year old
