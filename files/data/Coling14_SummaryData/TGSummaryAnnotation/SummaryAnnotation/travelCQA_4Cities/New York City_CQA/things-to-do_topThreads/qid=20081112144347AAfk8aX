I definatly thing you should go up the empire state building - there 'll probably be quite a queue but it 's totally worth it coz the view is amazing ! I 'm into art , so I went to a few of the gallerys which were brilliant because there 's so many fantastic and well known art works there . I also think you should get the boat ride or helicopter ride round the statue of liberty , I did n't do that but i really wish i had because I 've spoken to people who'e done that and they say it 's amazing . I know someone who went to ENTITY_new_york in the winter and she said its the best time to be there , so i reckon it 'll be interesting enough just being there ! I 'd also say try and take the oppurtunity to just visit different parts of ENTITY_new_york , or get a bus tour so you can feel like you 've actually experienced the whole of ENTITY_new_york . Hope you have a great time !

The museum of natural history is a favorite of mine , as well as the metropolitan museum of art . Go down to the village for the night life , go to around where ENTITY_washington square park is and find a good bar , they 're all good around there . Also , walk through central park during the day . Also , to see the whole city from above or below , either go to the top of the rock observation place at rockefeller center , or take the circle line cruise which is about 2 hours around ENTITY_new_york harbor . Both provide lots of beauty .

I 've visited NY on several occasions and never been attracted to Grand Central Station because it sounds like a big railway station . A New Yorker friend MADE me go and I was blown away by the style , dimensions , architecture , ambience , buzz . It 's unique and unforgetable . Do read up about it before you go -LRB- or get a guide -RRB- .
