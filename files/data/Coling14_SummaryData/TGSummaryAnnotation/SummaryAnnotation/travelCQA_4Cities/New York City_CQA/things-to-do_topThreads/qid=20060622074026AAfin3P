We went to central park and took a ride in a horse and cart , we went to the top of the empire state building , we went to a live jazz club on broadway , we went to see `` les miserables '' we went on a ferry ride to statten island , we took the subway to ENTITY_china town and little italy , we went to the site of the 9/11 attacks . We also went to a bar like the one off coyote ugly , girls dancing on the bar ! sawdust on the floor ! full works , amazing place ! Theres too much to cram into a small amount of time , my main recomendation would be to GO FOR LONGER ! p.s its such a busy city its a culture shock , be prepared for proper cramped conditions on the subways or avoid them between 8am and 9.30 am and 4.30 pm and 6.00 pm ! Its like a cattle market ! however they are safe to ride even very late at night !
