qid=20080326062015AA1vF8e_answer_1	1	qid=20080326062015AA1vF8e	2008-03-26 07:21:13	best_answer	 There are so many great museums here ... it really depends on what your personal preference is . My other key piece of advice for going to museums - do n't try and see the whole museum at once ! Pick either a special exhibit that you might like , or a time period or style of art that appeals to you . Trying to see the entire Met -LRB- Metropolitan Museum of Art -RRB- one day is art overload - you do n't even appreciate it after the second hour when you are hungry and your feet hurt . For instance - the main exhibit at the ENTITY_Guggenheim is not for everyone : http://www.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/exâ€?Main exhibit at ENTITY_MoMA - http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/exhibitiâ€?The ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History has a special exhibit on butterflys that actually includes live butterflys ! - http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/ Those are really the top three museums in the city - you ca n't go wrong and will probably see something that you like . Make sure and take the time to sit and take it in . Also wear comfortable shoes and make sure you take time to eat !

If you go you 'll remember the experience for the rest of your life , I ca n't put into words how great it is ... Please visit . . You can thank me later .

The building itself is a piece of art designed by ENTITY_Frank_Lloyd_Wright . They change out the art regularly . Its a large spiral . . you start at the top and work your way down . It was designed like that so you see every piece of work ... unlike some huge places like the Met where you could spend the whole day wandering from room to room and still miss things . Hope that helps !

Eqyptian Art is really nice , and so are the European Paintings ... you can get some lunch or tea there , buy a gift ...

They are also have a great exhibit on the work of ENTITY_Jasper_Johns , called ENTITY_Jasper_Johns : Gray . But , if you do decide to visit the Met , be prepared to spent your whole day there . - The Museum of the City of ENTITY_New_York has original works related to the history of ENTITY_New_York_City . - There is also the ENTITY_Museum_of_Jewish_Heritage , the Ukranian Museum , the Museum of African Art , ENTITY_El_Mueso_Del_Bario . - Another excellent museum that I would reccomend to you would be the ENTITY_American_Museum_of_Natural_History . The ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History , like the Met is HUGE , so if you visit here , your gon na be there all day . If I were you , I 'd take a visit to the ENTITY_Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art . Right now they are having the 2008 ENTITY_Whitney_Biennial . The Biennial is a showcase of the new trends of ENTITY_American art . The work shown here is VERY new and the artists are VERY young . Hope this helps !
