Central Park is huge but you can walk through it , spring and summer times are great since there are more street performers around , just a livlier atmosphere.Ground 0 is emotional but nothing much to see and it 's in the financial district where there really is nothing . Take a ferry to ENTITY_Elis_Island and the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty . Check out the ENTITY_Rockerfellar_Center . The best way to see NYC really is too just walk . You start at Times Square and you walk all the way up 5th ave to ENTITY_Central_Park . Also if you love desserts and chocolate you must check out ENTITY_Max_Brenners and have some chocolate soup . It is heavenly . Also 5 Guys has great burgers . Hope you have fun http://www.henatayeb.blogspot.com
