Admission is only 5 bucks , and they have several floors of stuff for the kids to see , touch , and play with . If you 're coming during the summer , you 've picked a great time ! There are a ton of free events going on all over the place . Check out this Web site : www.twi-ny.com . It 'll give you the rundown on all the free events going on in the city . I would take the kids to one of the outdoor movie screenings . They 've got some at ENTITY_Hudson_River_Park , ENTITY_Bryant_Park , and a couple other places . And did I mention it 's free ? And they tend to show kid-friendly movies like ENTITY_Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and ENTITY_Wallace and Grommit . Or how about taking in a Cyclone 's game at ENTITY_Coney_Island ? Ticket 's tend to be $ 5 - $ 20 . And then afterward you can hit the beach , go on a few rides , or play a few games . In Central Park there 's a merry-go-round that costs $ 1 to ride . South Street Seaport in the summer usually features some pretty funny street performers that are always a big hit with kids . Also , there 's a great playground for kids in ENTITY_Hudson_River_Park -LRB- enter on Chambers Street past the Westside Highway and just walk down -RRB- . The Bronx Zoo is always a fun place for kids , and it 's free on Wednesdays .

It 's about $ 40 for an adult ticket and less -LRB- maybe $ 20 -RRB- for a kid ticket , but it takes you EVERYWHERE - the Empire State Building , the ENTITY_UN building , the Chrysler Building , etc. . And you get to get off the bus and go into the buildings for a tour . I think the kids would really like that . Also , you could take a ferry out to the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty and let the kids climb up to the top of the crown and look out . And of course , Central Park is a good place to take kids and let them run around -LRB- before dark and supervised , of course -RRB- . There 's even a little zoo right in Central Park that you could take them to , or the ENTITY_Strawberry_Fields section that is a tribute to ENTITY_John_Lennon . It is a very lovely , scenic spot . Also , you 're better off skipping the expensive foofy restaurants and just having good old-fashioned ENTITY_New_York pizza and hot dogs from street vendors . Not only is it cheaper , but it 's very kid-friendly food . Have fun in ENTITY_New_York !

You can go to the top of the pedestal that she stands on for a nice view of ENTITY_Manhattan . Cheap things to do : walk around and keep your eyes and ears open . We 're always stumbling upon something interesting . Definitely ride the subway ... it 's a wonderful learning experience for kids . You see all kinds of people on the subway and it really makes the concept of ENTITY_America being a melting pot hit home . Plus it 's safe , fast , and cheap transportation . Go to Battery Park and walk along the river . Go to the ENTITY_National_Reserve_Bank . The tour is free and you get to go down into a vault full of gold ! It 's very cool ! Eat at ENTITY_Gray 's Papaya on the ENTITY_Upper_West_Side . Best hot dogs you 'll ever have and you can get the recession special for under $ 3.00 . The Shake Shack in Madison Square Park has great hamburgers and shakes for fairly cheap . Last suggestion : go to ENTITY_tripadvisor.com and type ENTITY_New_York_City into the search box . Then click on forum and ask questions there . Have a great trip !
