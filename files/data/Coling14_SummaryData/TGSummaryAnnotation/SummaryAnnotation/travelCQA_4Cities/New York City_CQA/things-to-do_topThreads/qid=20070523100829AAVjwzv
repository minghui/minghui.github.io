I would say , bring food from home , make a picnic at Central Park.Save about $ 10 to get some water and beef parties or pizza later on the evening . Go sightseeing , maybe visit the World Trade Center area.It is free . But , one thing though.You will need a metro card to go places , and that 's $ 2 for each person EACH WAY.Or if you have a car , you will need parking money because they will give tickets easily or revoke your car , depending on the situation . If you will take the subway to places , I suggest you buying the ALL Day unlimited metro card , which is $ 7 for each person.That is a must if you do n't have transportation . Good Luck .

A little known fact is that admission to both the ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art and the ENTITY_American_Museum_of_Natural_History * is on a suggested donation basis . If you have the nads to do it you can actually get into either one them for a buck . You could literally spend all day in either museum . The ENTITY_Staten_Island Ferry is free Walking in ENTITY_Manhattan is free \ Walking across the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge is free and cool to do Since you are mobile you can check out all sorts of fun things and neighborhoods . If you are in ENTITY_Chinatown lunch specials will give you more value for the dollar than ENTITY_Mickey_D 's will . better food too * I just called the ENTITY_Museum_of_Natural_History , as of 2:17 PM today the suggested donation policy is still in effect . Have fun
