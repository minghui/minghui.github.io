Or take a horse carriage ride through Central Park , , , , or visit the ENTITY_Hayden_Planitarium or the Museum of Modern Art or the Googenheim Museum -LRB- all of which can be researched on ENTITY_Yahoo_Search or ENTITY_Google -RRB- . . Also , take a trip to Battery park and hop the ferry for a ride out to the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty where you can now go up into the Crown and view the port of NY and ENTITY_NJ and NYC skyline from the statue itself . Foods can be eaten on EVERY BLOCK in the city -- with little cafes dotting the streets and quaint little bistros ... for more advanced -LRB- and EXPENSIVE -RRB- tastes , there is the ENTITY_Russian_Tea_Room , the Tavern on the Green , but for a real treat , do NOT come to ENTITY_NYC without sampling the delicious and ENTITY_HUGE_New_York_Style Pizza ... it outranks the stuff they CALL pizza in ENTITY_Chicago by about 150 % . . !!!! Have a great time in NYC ... Bring a coat -- it gets windy and cool there this time of year ...
