If you ca n't bag a bargin there then you wo n't get one any where . the biggest saving to be made is by going to the ticket booth below the Marriot on Times square and getting a half price ticket for a Broadway show .

If you 're going from the ENTITY_UK everything 's a bargain compared to how ripped off we are here . There 's a whole designer discount ` village ' -LRB- I ca n't remember the name -RRB- but I know you get there by bus from ENTITY_Port_Authority -LRB- ENTITY_New_York_City -RRB- . IN ENTITY_New_York_State there 's an outlet ` village ' in ENTITY_Buffalo but be warned the air there smells like sewerage .

You can take a walk for free , renting a rowboat on the pond is really cheap and fun . Some museums are `` suggested admission '' so even if they `` suggest '' you pay $ 20 , you can give them a dollar and get in - the Met and Natural History Museum and the Cloisters . The Bronx Zoo is free on Wednesdays , ENTITY_Moma is free on Friday nights . There are often free opera and ballet performance around the city and concerts also .

I know that ENTITY_New_York_Magazine from time to time has mention of places one can go for such things , and of course , all stores have sales
qid=20080224000847AApgene_answer_10	2	qid=20080224000847AApgene	2008-02-24 21:43:37 +0000	answer	 I 'd visit Woodberry Common , which is a large outlet in ENTITY_New_Jersey . The bus leaves from Ny to Nj many times throughout the day and lasts around 1 hour to 1 hour and a half depending on the traffic . Here you 'll find Juicy Couture , ENTITY_Ralph_Lauren , Guess and lots of other stores . The clothing etc are all sold at much cheaper prices , and tourists are given books , which they can use over and over again that give them maybe 10 % off in one store or else 30 % in another , it really just depends ! Enjoy your trip anyway ! If that does n't interest you then visit ENTITY_Chinatown for some FAKE but actually very good jewellery , bags and purses etc. .
