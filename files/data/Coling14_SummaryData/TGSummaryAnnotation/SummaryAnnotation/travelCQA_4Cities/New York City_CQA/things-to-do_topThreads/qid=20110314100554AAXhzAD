If you had a off in new York what would you do , me and my mom are taking a day off from work on Sunday but we do n't know what to do .

What do you guys think and where would you go and what time is best . Thanks

Go to lower ENTITY_Manhattan and ride the boat to ENTITY_Ellis_Island , even if you do n't get off . The ride is terrific , you get magnificent views of ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty and ENTITY_Lower_Manhattan , & if you do go ashore the exhibits at ENTITY_Ellis are quite well done . When you return to Battery Park , take the short subway ride over to ENTITY_Brooklyn , get a slice , then walk across the Bridge back to ENTITY_Manhattan , a20 minute walk with breathtaking views of ENTITY_Manhattan . Returning to ENTITY_Little_Italy , get a nice desert and coffee , then ride the subway back up to Midtown to walk around Rockefeller Center , peek at ENTITY_Radio_City , saunter over to the Empire State Bldg for a neck-craning , and you 'll be tired but exhilarated when it 's time to go home .
