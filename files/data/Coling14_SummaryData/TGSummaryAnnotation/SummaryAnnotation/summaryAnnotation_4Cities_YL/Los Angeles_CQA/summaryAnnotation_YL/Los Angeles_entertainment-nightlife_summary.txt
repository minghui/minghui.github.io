Once again , be careful : These places may be frequented by jerks who just want to pick up some pretty young naive girls for their own pleasure . 
Club One Seven is an Under-21 dance club at ENTITY_Hollywood_&_Highland , open only on weekends , $ 20 cover .
Every single club on the ENTITY_Sunset_Strip . I adore all of them ! : Whisky a go go Key Club The Viper Room Roxy The Cat Club Troubadour -LRB- not on Sunset strip .
Here are some clubs for you : Comedy Clubs : Laugh Factory , 8001 Sunset Blvd , ENTITY_Hollywood , CA 90046 Comedy Store , 8433 W Sunset Blvd , ENTITY_Los_Angeles , CA 90069 ENTITY_West_Hollywood_Bars_&_Clubs_A.O.C. 8022 W Third St , ENTITY_Los_Angeles , ENTITY_CA_Start with smart conversation over small plates and wine .
If you want to slum it with the hipsters drink at the ENTITY_Golden_Gopher , ENTITY_Broadway_Bar and ENTITY_Redwood_Bar_&_Grill .
Purchasing Park ENTITY_Hopper passes online in advance will save you a little money , and the longer the pass the more you save .
You have several options when planning a ENTITY_Disneyland stay . Check out the packages of local hotels -LRB- check out ENTITY_Harbor and ENTITY_Chapman area in Garden Grove -RRB- , as well as the ENTITY_Disneyland resorts . 
But if you want to do the tourist thing Hollywood Blvd would be cool too Again it pretty much depends on what you think is fun because ENTITY_LA has a lot to choose from whether it be Olvera Street for Mexican or going to Club Avalon or ENTITY_Spundea @ Circus for some good music .
take a walk up and down hollywood bld between ENTITY_La_Brea and western it dont cost anything and u will enterained by not only the sites but the people u see b carfull and have a good time
Find a cheap place to park and go look at all the Stars on the Walk of Fame . Also hit ENTITY_Mann 's Chinese Theater as well .
I would also prefer to go to ENTITY_Universal_City -LRB- maybe 10 min . from WOF -RRB- to ENTITY_Universal_Studios . 
ENTITY_LA is full of gorgeous women - why ? because a lot of people here want to be in the entertainment industry and being attractive and fit helps .
A great place to meet women is in a bar setting , because everyone is more relaxed . 
There is a lot of different races all over ENTITY_LA , but right now a club that is a little more ethnically diverse than the others is a place called Opera near hollywood blvd. .
You should also check out ENTITY_Runyon_Caynon go for a hike , there are a ton of great looking women who you might be able to chat up
