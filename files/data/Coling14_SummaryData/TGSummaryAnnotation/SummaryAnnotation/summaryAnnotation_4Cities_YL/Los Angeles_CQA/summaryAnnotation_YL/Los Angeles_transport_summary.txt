our buses tend to be slow , and often there are long wait times for transfers , and the buses do n't run nearly as often as they did when I was a kid .
if you lived in ENTITY_Torrance , went to ENTITY_UCLA , and worked in ENTITY_Santa_Monica , you 'd better get a car or be prepared to spend a lot of time on the bus .
Getting to ENTITY_UCLA is the 720 rapid from the ENTITY_Purple_Line or Red Line -LRB- Get off at Vermont/Wilshire -RRB- at ENTITY_Wilshire which takes 30 minutes if I remember .
Public transportation in la suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks and do n't even get on the bus after 9 pm it 's full of homeless and crazy people
you could easily use a taxi , but ENTITY_LAX is roughly 20 miles from most ot the things you want to see , and the taxi fare would be VERY expensive .
We have limited light rail and subway , it works really well , it would be convenient to take from ENTITY_Universal_Studios_/_City_Walk into ENTITY_Hollywood to do the touristy
Getting to and from ENTITY_LAX , the shared van services , such as ENTITY_SuperShuttle , are much cheaper than getting a cab just for one person .
You can also use the Downtown Area Short Hop buses which run between ENTITY_Hollywood , the Westside and downtown every 5 to 20 minutes depending on time of day .
ENTITY_Metro is already reasonably adequate .11 % of Angelenos use public transportation as their primary method of travel
If you need to travel in any other direction than a straight line you have to change buses/trains/subways to get where you want to go , and those transfers can often be very time consuming .
If you want to go to ENTITY_LA for sightseeing , take the `` Flyaway '' bus to Union Station .
You would eventually have to use the Green Line to the Aviation Street Station then use the free `` G '' shuttle to the airport .
Do understand that except for a few places downtown , in ENTITY_LA , taxis are not allowed to accept riders who try to flag them .
if you 're going to spend a few weeks in ENTITY_LA the best way to travel around ENTITY_LA usin public transportation is to buy an ENTITY_LA_Metro tap-card which costs about $ 60-70 and valid thru month
ENTITY_Metro rail runs till 11-12pm , buses all night long but not all of them and mostly once in an hour at night .
