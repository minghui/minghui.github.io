here 's my suggestion that 's not too expensive At downtown ENTITY_Disney , there 's Catals .
If you want just a quick breakfast , there 's the La Brea bakery near the check in part of ENTITY_Disneyland -LRB- on the Downtown Disney side -RRB- .
There 's a ENTITY_Coco 's at W Katella Av and S West St , due south of the Paradise Pier Hotel . Yummy food in good portions .
ENTITY_IHOP is just a hop down the street . The food is wholesome and the prices are reasonable .
Here are my faves for nice local restaurants : Restaurant ENTITY_Christine -LRB- has vegetarian options -RRB- , ENTITY_Petros in ENTITY_Manhattan_Beach -LRB- also with vegetarian options -RRB- , ENTITY_Kincaid 's in ENTITY_Redondo .
restaurant christine is pretty good these arent strictly veggie , but they have veggie options
My favorite place to eat there is the The Empress Pavilion , where you can have dim sum .
Do n't go to Ocean Seafood Restaurant , they 're highly overrated , and their food is generic , and their waiters are so ridiculously rude !
Go to Foo Chow Restaurant , again the food is generic , meaning you find the same everywhere , but they have better prices and service !
If you like ENTITY_BBQ should consider eat in the ENTITY_Sam_Woo . 
ENTITY_Little_Tokyo most famouse restaurant probably ENTITY_Daikokuya_Ramen .
The Chicken Dinner Restaurant is very good but very busy .
If you want to eat in a strange and kitschy restaurant go to ENTITY_Clifton 's Cafeteria .
Go for a hike Miniture Golf Eat at one of the many restaurants -LRB- ENTITY_Antonios for pizza or ENTITY_Armstrongs for seafood ...
W 's ENTITY_China_Bistro in ENTITY_Redondo , ENTITY_H.T._Grill -LRB- all have vegetarian options
