I personally recommend the ENTITY_LA_QUINTA_INN_&_SUITES_ANAHEIM or the TRAVELODGE ENTITY_ANAHEIM ...
The two I always recommend are the Candy Cane Inn and the ENTITY_Howard_Johnso
I would reccomend the ENTITY_Disney hotel because it is right next to ENTITY_Down_Town_Disney
If money is not a factor : The Grand Californian Hotel is BEAUTIFUL !
I recommend the Jolly ENTITY_Roger_Inn , which is a ENTITY_Disneyland_Resort good neighbor hotel .
The hotels across the street from ENTITY_Disneyland are called ENTITY_Disneyland 's `` Good Neighbor Hotels .
I suggest the Custom Hotel . It 's still very close to the airport but off the main strip
If you want a really fun time , try staying in ENTITY_Santa_Monica near the pier .
I recommend the Farmer 's Daughter Hotel near Third and ENTITY_Fairfax , a pretty safe area right in the middle of the city .
The best ENTITY_Hollywood hotels : the W ENTITY_Hollywood_Loew 's ENTITY_Hollywood_Hotel_Hollywood_Roosevelt_Hotel_Loew 's Hollywood Hotel is excellent
The Hotel ENTITY_Catherine is the closest to the dock , but it is a real dump . 
I 'd suggest The Desert Palms Hotel and Suites , it 's a short walk from ENTITY_Disneyland 's main entrance .
ENTITY_AAE_Hotel_Anaheim_Disney is inexpensive , but hard to find .
Of these , my favorite would be ENTITY_Anaheim_Portofino_Inn and Suites ... which also has free parking , and a cheap shuttle that takes you to ENTITY_Disneyland
If you are looking for a hotel where you can check in under 21 , there are 3 that I know of : The Menage The Clarion Red Roof Inn The Menage has the best location , almost directly under the ENTITY_Disney fireworks .
