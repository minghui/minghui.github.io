A heritage site , CHIJMES offers an exciting shopping , dining , leisure and entertainment experience .
All the big name such as ENTITY_Hyatt , Mandarin etc. are there 
If you want a posh hotel with a colonial feel , try the Raffles hotel .
Shangri-La Hotel , ENTITY_Singapore 22 ENTITY_Orange_Grove_Rd. . ENTITY_Singapore 258350 ENTITY_Singapore_Ranks_# 1 of 139 hotels in ENTITY_Singapore in ENTITY_TripAdvisor 's popularity index Four Seasons Hotel ENTITY_Singapore 
 Best value for money is the ENTITY_Grand_Plaza_Parkroyal
I suggest that you look into the Pan Pacific Hotel which is located in the Central Business District .
ENTITY_Singapore have lot of budget hotel especially in little ENTITY_india .
Hotels in ENTITY_Singapore are expensive even hotel 81 are charging around S$ 80 + per night and that is for a double . 
I would suggest any area near Bugis , City Hall or ENTITY_Little_India .
I recommend Harborville Hotel , safe , nice and clean -LRB- a bit farther the center , but easy by Bus
If you are coming with your family and not too fussy with having a very beautiful grand or classy hotel , then I would recommend Hotel Grand Central , a little old but deep inside the city with the subway nearby .
The other Hotel nearby is Hotel ENTITY_Haminton , a very small no frills hotel , location is great , value for money .
You can try staying @ ENTITY_Marriott_Singapore , ENTITY_Hyatt , ENTITY_Meritus_Mandarin , Park Hotel - ENTITY_Orchard .
For tourist calss , The Mirama Hotel , Bay View Hotel , Strand Hotel or The Grand Hotel , which might cost a little more .
for that rate , you can get a good hotel like ENTITY_Copthorne_Orchid_Hotel_Singapore that i found on 88db , or you can also try Crown 's Hotel @ ENTITY_Orchard , ENTITY_Hilton_International_Singapore , and Hotel Grand Central , all are located at ENTITY_Orchard_Rd.
