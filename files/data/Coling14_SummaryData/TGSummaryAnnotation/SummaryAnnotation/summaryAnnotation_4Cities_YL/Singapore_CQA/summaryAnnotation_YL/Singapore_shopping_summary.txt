ENTITY_Orchard_Road_Try_Shaw_Center_Takashimaya S.C ENTITY_Nee_Ang_Cheng_Yeah , basically all up and down orchard road .
few shopping places like ENTITY_Parkway_Parade -LRB- and outside Parkway Parade -RRB- , ENTITY_Takashimaya , Tangs , Paragon , ENTITY_Robinson , ENTITY_John_Little ... mostly at ENTITY_Orchard_Road_Area . .
Do shop at heartland malls such as J8 , Bugis street , Causeway for the best bargains . 
While shopping in ENTITY_Sim_Lim , if you spot an item of your choice , watch out for the local to ask for the price , and be observant , and you will know the right price . 
However , ENTITY_Funan IT mall products are reasonable price .
there is a place that sells all the things you want , try ENTITY_Suntec_City_Mall
Courts is the biggest retail change store with 8 outlet '' one stop retail '' for Furniture / Electronics items / Cameras / Home Appliances / IT products / Home Audio
ENTITY_Takashimaya , ENTITY_Plaza_Singapura , ENTITY_Robinsons , ENTITY_Centerpoint , ENTITY_Orchard_Plaza , etc. . are some of the malls in ENTITY_Orchard_Road for you to get good and cheap clothes 
to top that , i would say u should shop at ENTITY_Mustafa_Centre .
I really like ENTITY_VivoCity , and it was rated as the best Shopping Mall Experience in ENTITY_Singapore .
try your hand haggling in ENTITY_Chinatown or Clementi Marketplace or any other little roadside marketplace . 
ENTITY_mose_of_Shop_&_Save , Cold storage still in business , even 24 hours in some Branch .
If you have time , visit also a ENTITY_HDB town centre , ENTITY_e.g._Toa_Payoh , where there are bargains in the mom-and-pop shops .
ENTITY_Changi_Village , ENTITY_Jalan_Kayu Night Market , ENTITY_Arab_Street , Bugis Street , ENTITY_Bedok_Corner , depending what you want to buy .
Try Toyogo at ENTITY_Toa_Payoh , heard that it has lots of stuff
