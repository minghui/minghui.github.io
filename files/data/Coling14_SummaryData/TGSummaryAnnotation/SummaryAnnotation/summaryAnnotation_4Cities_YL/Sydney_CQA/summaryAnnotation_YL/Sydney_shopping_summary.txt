We had a great time with the cruise and the shopping .
I've been going to to Paddington markets for years, and never had a problem of any kind.
If you are looking for something similar to Paddington markets then I would say Glebe Markets, The Rocks Markets, Fringe Bar Markets 
 Its not like they can make you order na appetizer or dessert !
you can order just a main course or even just an appetiser at a restaurant without having to have 3 course meals .
Get off at ENTITY_Katoomba and wander around the shops and cafes there -LRB- and also do some bush walking -RRB-
Paddy 's Market 's for shopping is really cool : -RRB-
 u can walk around darling harbour and there is paddy 's markets , upstairs there is market city , movies , timezone , go to the apple store and play on the ipods/computers -- > its free =] , just some of thee stuff i do hope i helpedd
if you wan na some bargin or cheap hair extensions go to paddys market , it 's like one of the biggest markets in ENTITY_syndey .
Paddy 's markets - the cheapest -LSB- but not sure how good the quality is 
its the bets place its a massive long man road from circular quay till like the bottom on the city and it has shops all the wall down it and about 8 malls inside it .
to tell you the truth , this area is the crappiest place to shop ENTITY_LOL .
you can go to ENTITY_Jay_Jays . . they have some cheap clothes there as well . .
 When you get to ENTITY_sydney just look for a ENTITY_westfield shopping centre/mall . . And you will find stuff around thats cheap ... 
 make sure you go to a westfield shopping centre they have a lot of shops i suggest stores like ENTITY_General_Pants_Bardot_Glue store Zero Urban equipment Myer ENTITY_David_Jones ...
