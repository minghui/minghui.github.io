The rocks is the birthplace of ENTITY_European_Australia . 
Definitly a place worth visiting ... from there walk around the harbour front , around the ENTITY_Opera_House and then on through the Botanical Gardens 
couple of place come to mind like some of the eastern suburbs areas that are high placed. 
But what really inspired me the first time, was the supper cruise with John Cadman, then it was the Explorer 2000, not sure what they have now.
But to Cruise the harbor at night, and see all those lights, to see the Opera house lit up at night as well as the bridge, was awesome.
You can try out the BridgeClimb - this is a climb on to the Harbour bridge.
The best view of Sydney at night is from the top of Sydney Tower, often called Centrepoint Tower (the original name). 
 The hills in the Sydney suburbs are not particularly high and views are blocked by buildings and trees. 
I found if I get out of the CBD , and out to the suburbs , like a suburb called ENTITY_Cabramatta , a heavy ENTITY_Asian influence , smell , feel and touch the influences .
Visit the ENTITY_Alexander the Great visiting exhibition showing at the Australian Museum -LRB- facing ENTITY_Hyde_Park -RRB- all through January
 ENTITY_Sydney is also home to ENTITY_Opera_Australia , which is ENTITY_Australia 's ONLY truly full time opera company 
Barrenjoey Lighthouse and Palm Beach (northern beaches area) - take the sea plane there from rose bay.
Museum of Contemporary Art; take a train trip or bus trip to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains, and go on the three spectacular cable care 'rides', or just noodle about Katoomba village, get a ferry ride across to Manley and walk to the beach through the mall, then visit the aquarium there. 
Apart from the ENTITY_Opera_House_&_Harbour_Bridge , the ENTITY_Harbour itself , as the backdrop for the City , attracts people from all over the world
Blue mountains , ENTITY_Sydney aquarium , Darling harbour , ENTITY_Sydney harbour itself is of great attraction for tourist .
