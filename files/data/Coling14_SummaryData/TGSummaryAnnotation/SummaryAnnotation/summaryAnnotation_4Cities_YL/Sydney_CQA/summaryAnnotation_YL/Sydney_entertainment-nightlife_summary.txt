They usually have a seafood buffet or something and you can find ones that do have jazz nights etc.
Near the opera house there is the opera bar, with a live band, so if you are interested in a show and dinner, that would be the place to go.
In the city, closer to accommodation, lots of great bars, clubs and restauants are only a short walk away.
if you want an interesting bar go to minus 5 degrees in Sydney. 
The best view of Sydney at night is from the top of Sydney Tower, often called Centrepoint Tower (the original name). 
but I was taken to a few places like St George Leagues Club, Parramatta Leagues Club, Club Marconi, Rooty Hill RSL., the last one was a bit on the wild side.
Home bar is rubbish, even when they open all the levels its still pretty crap.
I'd suggest having the party at World Bar, its not too expensive and its one of the few clubs in the whole city where you don't have to scream your lungs out just to talk to the person next to you.
I think if you are a uni student , some places to go Sidebar which has a real international crowd as it is under a hostel .
In the rocks hands out my favorite place was ENTITY_Cargo_Bar , Home nightclub is also really cool has a young crowd because they advertise a lot at various uni and they have awesome drink specials usually a 2 shot , a four dollar beer , and one drink that is on discount .
Well the night club scene in ENTITY_Sydney moves from week to week , so it is hard to find out where the best places are .
For tourists there are a number of popular bars in the Rocks area -LRB- eg ENTITY_Australia Hotel -RRB- . ENTITY_George street has a number of bars . 
 You go for a hike and at the end you go to the pub for a drink .
There are pubs, clubs, restaurants and the city is a bus or ferry away.
DCMs Saturday night at UNSW or Home nightclub, have good RnB
