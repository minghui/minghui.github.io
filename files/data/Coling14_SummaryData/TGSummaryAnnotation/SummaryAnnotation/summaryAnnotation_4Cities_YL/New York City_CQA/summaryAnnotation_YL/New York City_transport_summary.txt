Drive to the Path Station in ENTITY_Hoboken NJ and take the path train into the city .
Just park a few blocks away and walk or park far away and take a cab to manhatan . 
I know people whose entire lives seem to revolve around alternate side of the street parking . 
If you leave the airport go by cab . Public transport will eat up your time . 
Best option is to park at either the ENTITY_Poughkeepsie or ENTITY_Croton_Harmon train station .
My friend , there are several parking facilities near the ENTITY_Poughkeepsie train , where you can park your car for several days for a few bucks . 
With insurance , parking and maintenance , tolls , registration , etc , it will be tough to keep plus keeping up your tuition .
Having a car requires you to have a job to pay for insurance , maintenance , gas , parking fees .
Well if you can handle the traffic in ENTITY_Manhattan then rent a car definately .
I suggest that if you want to drive , you should park somewhere , and go to the tourists attractions by walking or taking public transportation . 
You want to battle with the worst traffic in the nation and fight for parking space in ENTITY_New_York_City , specially in ENTITY_Manhattan .
ENTITY_Real_New_Yorker take public transit , which is the best and cheapest way to go .
With a car in NYC , sometimes it 's like so hard to find a parking space but , with a car in NYC , you do n't have to wait for a train bus or especially the taxi .
Shuttle bus service from ENTITY_JFK to ENTITY_Manhattan is reasonably inexpensive .
So times square and cannel street are about 20 minuets with traffic , 15 without .
