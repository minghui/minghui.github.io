Once you decide on where you are going to stay , call the concierge desk of the hotel and have him schedule a private van or towncar service for you from ENTITY_JFK . 
There are good rates available at any of the ENTITY_Manhattan_East Suite Hotels .
I 'd go with the ENTITY_Hampton . All the ones I 've ever stayed at were clean and well run and include free breakfast . 
 I 've read over at ENTITY_TripAdvisor.com that it 's a good idea to stay over in ENTITY_Long_Island_City and take the subway into ENTITY_Manhattan , as it 's pretty close by , evidently .
 You are better off looking around ENTITY_Astoria or ENTITY_Long_Island_City
 Very safe , clean area , lots of hotel options , nightlife , attractions and is one subway stop to ENTITY_manhattan , which is most likely where you will spend most of your time .
ENTITY_Colonial_House_Inn_Courtesy_of_the_Colonial_Inn_Housed in an 1850s townhouse , the ENTITY_Colonial_House_Inn welcomes both gay & straight visitors . 
Unfortunately , the only place to find a cheap hotel in this city will be in ENTITY_Long_Island_City , ENTITY_Queens , which is located on the other side of the ENTITY_East_River from ENTITY_Manhattan . 
ENTITY_Continental breakfast , a rooftop patio and an internet kiosk are available for guest use . 
ENTITY_Royal_Park_Hotel_&_Hostel is in the ENTITY_Upper_West_Side
I love and recommend The ENTITY_Essex_House 
ENTITY_Hotels_Trump_International_Hotel_&_Tower_New_York -LRB- which is actually a 5 star hotel but you never know so check the rates before you book
The ENTITY_Wellington is a 3 star hotel but it may prove to be more affordable 
When you need views from any hotel , be sure to notify them verbally and in advance 
Check out the ENTITY_Milford_Plaza , it is centrally located and compared to many other NYC hotels it is relatively inexpensive , but that is NYC standards so it is still about $ 230 a night .
