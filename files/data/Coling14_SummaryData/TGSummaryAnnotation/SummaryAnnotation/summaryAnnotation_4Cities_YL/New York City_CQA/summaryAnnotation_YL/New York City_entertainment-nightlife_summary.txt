if you like Jazz , there are countless Jazz clubs all around town , but a large concentration of them in ENTITY_Greenwich_Village
if you like more Classical Music or Opera , check out what 's going on at ENTITY_Lincoln_Center or Carnegie Hall 
there are numerous Art Movie Houses around town showing foreign and independent films not showing anywhere else 
In the summer , you can find free concerts all over the city outdoors , free movies along the piers and other places , dancing outside at ENTITY_Lincoln_Square or in ENTITY_Riverside_Park_etc. 
there are comedy clubs , and of course a ENTITY_Mets or ENTITY_Yankee 's game , but even more fun would be to take the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bound_Q train to the last stop ENTITY_Stillwell_Avenue in ENTITY_Coney_Island , get nathan 's ENTITY_Franks and Fries and go see a ENTITY_Brooklyn_Cyclones baseball game .
The ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art is amazing and the rooftop has such a commanding view of Central park The Museum of Modern Art -LRB- ENTITY_MoMa -RRB- Tour the ENTITY_UN headquarters Walk down 5th avenue .
In NYC , pretty much you wo n't need to worry about entertainment , because there 's some everywhere you go.
As for music , other than Broadway shows like Wicked , there are ENTITY_Lincoln_Center and ENTITY_Carnegie_Hall . 
A number of night spots with music may not be available to a 14 year old . 
 In addition , you should consider taking him to the ENTITY_United_Nations , for both a tour and to see the shops in the lower floor .
There are spots here where if you hang around just about every famous person you ever heard of will walk by . 
So many movies and televsion shows use the city for a backdrop that you can even watch this being done .
