Well I just shop for myself , so I usually do n't have more than 2 bags , but most people use those metal carts with wheels . 
I usually buy a small amount of groceries at a time and carry them home in a few canvas bags and a backpack 
ENTITY_Macy_'s -LRB- West 34th Street and Broadway in the heart of Hearld Square
Canal street will have your purses , 34th street is way too congested but all the stores are there . 
ENTITY_China town has SOOOOOO much knock off purses ... its crazy theres chinease people running around yelling gucci guccii prada prada
Union Square -LRB- from Broadway to 8th Avenue -RRB- . You will find stores like Basement , ENTITY_Virgin_Store , ENTITY_Urban_Outfitters , ENTITY_Diesel , Forever 21 plus a bunch of small stores -LRB- good price
Again another area with a bunch of stores such as ENTITY_H&M , Gap , Forever , ENTITY_Victoria_'s , ENTITY_Express , Macys , Old ENTITY_Navy and much more 
Fifth Avenue -LRB- between 20th Street to 14th Street -RRB- . I highly recomend because no many tourist know of these stores so you will be shopping with New Yorkers . 
ENTITY_H&M , ENTITY_Zara , ENTITY_Club_Monaco , Banana , Gap , ENTITY_Armani_Xchange , ENTITY_Bebe , ENTITY_Arden_B. , ENTITY_Diesel , and much more . 
ENTITY_West_Village is cool also Also through Bleecker for a bunch of cool stores . 
Last time I was in ENTITY_New_York 's ENTITY_Chinatown , they had some bags that were CLEARLY knock-offs in stores . 
Start out with a stroll along Central Park in the morning . 
Afterwards , take a cab down 5th Avenue - east side of the park , -LRB- ask to go to 34th Street/Empire State Building -RRB- , to go to the Empire State Building and the observation deck .
 Literally right across the street from ENTITY_Rockefeller_Center is ENTITY_Saks_Fifth_Avenue . 
Do n't forget to get to Times Square after dark - its amazing .
