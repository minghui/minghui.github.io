The ENTITY_Metropolitan_Musuem_of_Art http://www.metmuseum.org is one of the best in the world and its admission fee is a suggested amount so you can walk up and pay a buck or two to get in and see the fabulous collection .
The ENTITY_Staten_Island Ferry is the best view of the ENTITY_Statue_of_Liberty since it has perspective and is free .
The ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bridge is also a great place to walk for some views . 
In ENTITY_Lower_Manhattan you can view the World Trade Center site for free , go to the ENTITY_Chase_Bank_Money_Museum , walk through ENTITY_Chinatown -LRB- where the food is pretty cheap , try Wo Hop on ENTITY_Mott_Street -RRB- , and the ENTITY_South_Street_Seaport . 
The first time i was in NYC I only could stay there for a weekend so the first thing I did was buy a two day ticket tour on Grayline Tours -LRB- you get them in Times Square -RRB- .

Statue of ENTITY_Liberty , Empire State Building and of course last but not the least , the very famous TWIN TOWERS of the World Trade Center -LRB- what 's left of it
1 . Central Park - have to spend of some time there !!! , 2 . Times Square - you 'll have a great time . Can take in a Broadway Show if you like - other cool stuff there ! 3 . Take the ferry to ENTITY_Staten_Island you 'll go right by the statue of liberty - can take some pictures of it and it wo n't take too much time .
We went to central park and took a ride in a horse and cart , we went to the top of the empire state building , we went to a live jazz club on broadway , we went to see `` les miserables '' we went on a ferry ride to statten island , we took the subway to ENTITY_china town and little italy , we went to the site of the 9/11 attacks . 
Theres too much to cram into a small amount of time , my main recomendation would be to GO FOR LONGER ! 
Museum of Modern Art -RRB- ENTITY_Chinatown , ENTITY_Soho_Statue_of_Liberty_Niagra Falls Fifth Avenue Times Square Central Park Broadway More Shopping ... Ground Zero Empire State Building
