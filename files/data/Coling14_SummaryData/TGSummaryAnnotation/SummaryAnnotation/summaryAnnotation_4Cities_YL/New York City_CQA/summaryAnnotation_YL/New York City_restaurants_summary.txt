The best ENTITY_Deli ever is ENTITY_Katz 's Deli which is on the lower east side .
ENTITY_Balthazar in ENTITY_Soho -LRB- Spring Street & Broadway -RRB- for an amazing French evening with some of ENTITY_New_York 's fashionable people .
For the most unique , best food I 'd say go to ENTITY_Asia_De_Cuba on 39th and ENTITY_Madison .
Mid-price . I 'll agree with the person who said ENTITY_Lucky_Chengs .
Also , the Brickstone -LRB- I think that 's what it 's called -RRB- , on 6th Street between 2nd and 1st Avenue has really amazing Indian food at a reasonable price .
There are tons of other Indian places on 6th street and some of them have a sitar player , so you might want to choose one of those .
ENTITY_Benihana is a Japanese-style grill where they cook in front of you .
For dessert go to the Bourgeois Pig on 7th Street between 1st Ave. and Avenue A .
ENTITY_Carmine_'s . Its a family-style ENTITY_Italian restaurant & its delicious !
If your into spanish food go to ENTITY_Tio_Pepe on 4th between 6th & 7th Ave. . . the food is amazing .
The best food you can find would be in ENTITY_Little_Italy . 
 Watch TLC 's The Little Couple , ENTITY_NYC episode , the restaurant they ate at looked really good
Try going into a pizza place that is n't too touristy or out in the open and go to a family owned place .
ENTITY_New_York style Pizza , hot dogs , gyros , falafels , just look up the carts around rockfeller , there 's one near the ENTITY_Hilton that has a long line and is open only after 7 p.m. .
It also has other good ethnic food , like Greek food , etc.
