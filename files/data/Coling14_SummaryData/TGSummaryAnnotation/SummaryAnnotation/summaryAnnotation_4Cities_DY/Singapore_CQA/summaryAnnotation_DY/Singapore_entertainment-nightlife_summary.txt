ENTITY_Singapore has been branded for 1 of the TOP few asian countries that offers wonderful & hyper-entertaining night-life scenes and activities !!
Boat Quay / ENTITY_Clarke_Quay is good for a light night out , very westernised but good mix of travllers and locals .
ENTITY_Clark_Quay - great lighting , funky places to eat , drink and move to the music .
ENTITY_Robertson_Quay - not much of a dance-spot , but the atmosphere 's really great , especially at ENTITY_Brewerkz .
ENTITY_Fullerton - It was a nice romantic place to bring your date .
-RRB- ENTITY_Mount_Faber : from here you could have the bird 's eye view of ENTITY_Singapore from the top while enjoying fine dining or just sipping wine from many of the restaurants and pubs situated along the hill .
Alkaff Mansion : Isolated bungalow turned restaurant where you could enjoy your dinner in a serene environment .
One ENTITY_Rochester Road : A very big bungalow where they serve many varieties of food and they have different themes in different parts of the bungalow . There are corners for chilling out and having drinks .
Power Station -LRB- @ Sentosa Gateway -RRB- : If you are really into clubs and band places , do not miss this newest recreation centre . 
Orchard road , ENTITY_Marina_Square , ENTITY_Tanjong_Pagar_&_China_Square has lots of night life you can try it.That should be more than enough for your 4 nights in ENTITY_Singapore .
Cuppage Road just off ENTITY_Orchard street used to be my favourite . .
Also try all the pubs in Boat Quay and along ENTITY_River_Valley_Road and ENTITY_Mohammed_Sultan_Road .
the restaurant in sheraton towers is very relaxing and good food .
Zouk http://www.zoukclub.com - consists of ENTITY_Zouk and clubs like ENTITY_Phuture , Velvet Underground , and Wine Bar .
I 've seen reports that the nightlife in ENTITY_Singapore is second internationally only to ENTITY_Ibiza ... you work out the maths .
