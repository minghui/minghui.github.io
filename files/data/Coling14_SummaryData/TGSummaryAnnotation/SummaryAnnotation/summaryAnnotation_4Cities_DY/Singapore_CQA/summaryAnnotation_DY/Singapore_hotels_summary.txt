Hi , I would recommend staying in and around the following areas -- Marina-Raffles or Orchard . Transportation is really convenient from these locations to most attractions in ENTITY_Singapore , including by foot .
i guess for that rate , maybe you can try ENTITY_YMCA_International_House that can be found on 88db , it is located right in the heart of Singaporeâ€™s shopping , tourist and entertainment centre , or you can also try ENTITY_Orchard_Road_Boutique_Suites , and hotels near the city can be quite costly
there are lots of good hotels in ENTITY_Singapore , like ENTITY_Pan_Pacific , ENTITY_Le_Meridien , The Ascott ENTITY_Singapore , and many more which you can find list of them on 88db website , there are also some budget hotels , apartment or hostels which are good too , like the ENTITY_YMCA_International_House
If it 's a long stay , you can try the Hotel 81 at ENTITY_Chinatown .
Grand central hotel is closed to orchard Road -LRB- Famous road in ENTITY_Singapore -RRB- so is not bad location , i suggest you to book in other hotel like ENTITY_Marriott or Grand Hyatt because they are locate in orchard Road .
Most hotels in ENTITY_Singapore in the central area are 5 or 6 star hotels .
Plenty of 4 star hotels on ENTITY_Orchard road , but all Singaporean hotels are expensive .
The Oriental Hotel is expensive , but nice .
Can try ENTITY_Park_Royal_@_Kitchener_Road unless you do n't mind the location -LRB- in ENTITY_Little_India where the Indian workers hang around during their off days -RRB- OR Gallery Hotel / ENTITY_Furama in ENTITY_Town area .
I would recommend ENTITY_Swissotel_Merchant_Court hotel which is located along ENTITY_Singapore_River and opposite Clake Quay which has various restaurants and pubs in it .
If you both of you are female , I would not recommend you to stay in Hotel 81 chain or The Fragrance Hotel chain .
You can try staying @ ENTITY_Marriott_Singapore , ENTITY_Hyatt , ENTITY_Meritus_Mandarin , Park Hotel - ENTITY_Orchard . .
ENTITY_Royal_Plaza_on_Scotts is a nice hotel , however , be prepared for rooms without views .
I stayed in the ENTITY_Singapore Transit hotel in the airport - this hotel is only for people transiting into/out of ENTITY_Singapore .
You are better off in a backpacker Hostel which charge around s $ 50 per night for a room or from s $ 15 per night for a bunk bed .
