ENTITY_Indulgz_Bistro , went once very good food , if you order ice water , they will bring you a big bottle to let you refill yourself so you do n't have to keep asking them for refill and they were very polite and friendly .
ENTITY_Little_Red_House at ENTITY_East_Coast is good .
most Indian restaurants are along ENTITY_Serangoon and ENTITY_Race_Course_Roads -LRB- Little India Area -RRB- but you can find a few along ENTITY_Orchard_Road as well .
Just walk along ENTITY_Little_India in ingapore and you will find many varieties of vegetarian food .
I heard there is a restaurant inside the Botanical Garden , it should be quiet for you to enjoy the meal . Sorry I do not know the name of the restaurant ,
go to hawker centres , like ENTITY_hougang , angmokio , little ENTITY_india , newton circle , chom chom , ENTITY_clark quay , ENTITY_lau pasatt , foods are cheaper and authentic
But lots of ENTITY_Indian restaurants , ENTITY_Chinese vegetarian restaurants and of course , Mexican and Italian , so wide choice .

There is also a more expensive place in the Hyatt Hotel called Mezza-nine with choices from fresh sushi to grilled angus beef , which is great .
