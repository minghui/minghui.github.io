34th street is the fashion avenue . 
For shopping , all you have to do is walk down a street and you 're bound to see a great clothing store , like Gap , ENTITY_Abercrombie , ENTITY_H&M , etc. .
efinitely ENTITY_H&M ! There is one of 5th avenue and one in Herald Square near ENTITY_Macy_'s .
Great view of Central Park from the windows - there are seats . There are many upscale shops for window shopping .
You should definitely go to ENTITY_Jersey Gardens !
Also go to the ENTITY_Abercrombie_Store on 5th Avenue !
well go do some window shopping and walk around a lot , rest in Central park and spend the money on cold drinks and some hotdogs
Book now , I live outside of NYC and whenever I stay in town , I stay in the ENTITY_Marriott_Marquis -LRB- 45th & Broadway -RRB- .
Regardless , I recommend avoiding Times Square .
its all amazing but go to central park just to chill and walk around .
There are usually supermarkets within a 5 block radius of most apartments so it 's easy to walk and also the majority of supermarkets here offer delivery service so you can go shopping and purchase tons of groceries and have them delivered to your apartment in an hour .
My suggestions are the ENTITY_MoMA , ENTITY_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art , ENTITY_Museum_of_Nat_History , taking a picnic in Central Park , ENTITY_Chinatown , Times Square -LRB- wax museum is awesome , this is in Times Square -RRB- ... and shopping of course .
I suggest you to go to the Rockefeller Center .
5th Ave. around midtown has a lot of major designers if that 's your thing .
Or if you want to shop then go to Century 21 wlch is near Ground Zero .
