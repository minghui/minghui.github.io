Central Park - have to spend of some time there !!!
Times Square - you 'll have a great time
Take the ferry to ENTITY_Staten_Island you 'll go right by the statue of liberty - can take some pictures of it and it wo n't take too much time .
We went to central park and took a ride in a horse and cart , we went to the top of the empire state building , we went to a live jazz club on broadway , we went to see `` les miserables '' we went on a ferry ride to statten island , we took the subway to ENTITY_china town and little italy , we went to the site of the 9/11 attacks .
check out coney island , go shopping of course , and theres tons of places near ENTITY_chinatown and lower manhattan that are cheap and good , if your looking for something fancy go to little italy .
If you go in summer , you should go to ENTITY_Governors_Island .
I found the museum on ENTITY_Ellis_Island really interesting .
Go to the ENTITY_Sony building , where inside the atrium behind the store there 's sony world and it 's a free interactive exhibit tour .
THE SOUTH STREET SEAPORT It is magical to find a seaport at the base of a metropolitan area .
rying to see the entire Met -LRB- Metropolitan Museum of Art -RRB- one day is art overload - you do n't even appreciate it after the second hour when you are hungry and your feet hurt .
I suggest you to go to the Rockefeller Center .
I would reccomend Central Park definitely -- take out a row boat or play frisbee or sunbathe or just walk around the park .
Take the kids to the Children 's Museum in ENTITY_Manhattan on 86th street .
Definitely take a ride on the ENTITY_Staten_Island ferry -LRB- free -RRB- large boat refreshments on boat and everything ...
