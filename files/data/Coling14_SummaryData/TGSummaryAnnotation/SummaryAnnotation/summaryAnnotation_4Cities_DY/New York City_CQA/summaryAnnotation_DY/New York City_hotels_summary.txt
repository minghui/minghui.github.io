Two that I can recommend are : Big Apple Hostel Jazz on the Town -LRB- East Village location only -RRB-
They dont have half board hotels in ENTITY_America the best you will be able to get is room that includes breakfast , the hotels are expensive in ENTITY_New_York try searching for hostels or for hotels out of ENTITY_manhattan as this is the most expensive area and theres plenty of transport to get into the centre .
Close to Times SQ. , Broadway and Central Park is the ENTITY_Wellington , it 's decent enough and competitively priced for the area .
Chelsea Savoy Hotel One of the best bargains at this well-located ENTITY_Chelsea hotel is the quad room , which accommodates up to four guests for $ 155-375 a night .
We used to stay at the Mariott at the ENTITY_World_Trade_Center , until some bozos dropped a couple of buildings on it .
There are good rates available at any of the ENTITY_Manhattan_East Suite Hotels .
One of the best sites that I have used is for finding hotels is http://www.justhotelreservations.com - it find the best deals across 100 's of travel sites in one location .
Check out The ENTITY_London .
Also saw ENTITY_Ashton_Kutcher and ENTITY_Demi_Moore there -LRB- When they were still together obviously -RRB-
Try the ENTITY_Hotel_Pennsylvania , central Midtown location and you can book for rates as low as $ 99/night on this website
ENTITY_Hotels_Trump_International_Hotel_&_Tower_New_York -LRB- which is actually a 5 star hotel but you never know so check the rates before you book - you might just get a deal
The `` ENTITY_Warrick_New_York '' is four -LRB- 4 -RRB- star and is close ENTITY_Central_Park for views .
West 35 Street is fine , altho there is a former hotel at 35th and 8th Avenue which the ENTITY_Moonies took over , so do n't expect to get a room there .
A few I can mention will be the ENTITY_New_York_Sharaton on West 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenue , the ENTITY_Westin_Times_Square on 8th Avenue and 43rd Street ; and the ENTITY_Marriott_Marquee on Broadway between 43rd and 44th Street .
I highly recommend staying in Times Square at least once especially if you are a first time visitor to ENTITY_New_York_City .
