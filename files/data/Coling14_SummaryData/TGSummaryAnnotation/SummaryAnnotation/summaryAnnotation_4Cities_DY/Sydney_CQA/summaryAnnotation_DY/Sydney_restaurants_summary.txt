There are some nice restaurants in East Circular Quay -LRB- ie a short stroll from the Rocks around the harbour - go past the ferry terminals and head toward the ENTITY_Opera_House -RRB- .
In ENTITY_Port_Douglas , there is a place on Macrossan Street -LRB- ie the main street -RRB- that does great wood fired pizza .
Go to the two major restaurant areas close to the city - ENTITY_Darlinghurst , along ENTITY_Oxford_Street , and ENTITY_Newtown , along King Street . 
I live in Sydney and would thoroughly recommend Darling harbour/Sydney city as a good place to eat out at.
Along the waterfront, there are an array of excellent restaurants ranging from char grill to seafood.
For students it is usually King st in ENTITY_Newtown , with lots of restaurants , cafes and bars . Many of the pubs become more night clubish at night on weekends .
ENTITY_China town is good too , but not the main street -LRB- where it is hard to find any real chinese food , as it is mostly Japanese , ENTITY_vietnam and other asian countries -RRB- but in the surrounding area .
Out of ENTITY_Africa in Manly Superbowl or BBQ King in ENTITY_Chinatown -LRB- Service and decor is crap but the food is great 
The ENTITY_Sydney_Morning_Herald has a food liftout every Tuesday , with restaurant reviews and general food chit-chat .
Also ENTITY_Ashfield is a great place for ENTITY_Chinese food , burwood is very multicultural with one of the best chinese bakeries I know .
I discovered a new place in ENTITY_Sydney called ` The Sanctuary ' its a nice pub/bar that is big , clean and fresh with yummy fod and extremely reasonable prices , its just normal stuff , risotto , pasta , steak , etc but its kind of like being able to go out for a decent meal without paying a whopping price for it - its in ENTITY_Liverpool_Street , sort of neat the Spanish Club .
King St ENTITY_Newtown and ENTITY_Glebe are great places to find a huge range of inexpensive restaurants that serve good food .
Any of the pubs have OK food , ENTITY_Phillips foot is OK the best is the rock pool .
Go to the Meat and Wine in ENTITY_Darling_Harbour .
An evening harbour cruise would also be nice .
