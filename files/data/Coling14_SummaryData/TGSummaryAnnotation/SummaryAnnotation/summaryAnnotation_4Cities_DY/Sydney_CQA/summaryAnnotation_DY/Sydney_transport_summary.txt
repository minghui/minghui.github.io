It took me a little over 10hr to drive from ENTITY_Melbourne to ENTITY_Sydney -LRB- during night and within speed limit -RRB- , but I only stopped for gas and bathroom , so if you spend time in motel , you will not make it .
once your in the city your in walking distance of most places or just a short train/bus/ferry ride away .
I suggest renting a car Train and bus system is quite good but a rental car would be a better option to maximise your five days
In general ENTITY_Sydney trains are safe at any time .
The trains are becoming more and more pleasing to use now .
There is a good bus system ... also trains that can get you up and down the coast .
It 's very simple - depending on traffic conditions between $ 25 - $ 35 with a $ 5 tip . 
Even though ENTITY_Sydney_Airport says $ 25 -30 .
ENTITY_Rachael , of course you can catch a taxi from ENTITY_Newcastle to ENTITY_Sydney , but one thing I found out , on a one way long distance cab journey , you also pay the return for the cab .
You can take the ENTITY_CityRail service from the Airport to the CBD using the ENTITY_Airport_&_East_Hills_Line .
Seven CityRail stations exist in the CBD , with Circular Quay being closest to the ENTITY_Opera_House , both located in the northern parts of the CBD which extends southwardly to Central Station .
The train from the airport will take you to central , then around the city loop -LRB- the city circle -RRB- back to central gain .
from ENTITY_Mo to LAX to ENTITY_Sydney round trip base it in the order of $ 2700,00 .
The flight is exactly 13.5 hours direct from Syd to LA, wheels up syd to touch down LAX, done it many times and have had my stop- watch on.
Buy an east coast explorer rail pass allows up to 6 months travel all the way up the east coast v. v. cheap but a buspass is even cheaper and you can buy them in miles rather than point to point a campervan can work out very expensive especially with all the petrol and insurance you need .
