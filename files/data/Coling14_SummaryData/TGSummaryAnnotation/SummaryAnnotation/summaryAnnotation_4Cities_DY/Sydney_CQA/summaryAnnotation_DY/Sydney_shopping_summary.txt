I love the QVB -LRB- Queen Victoria Building -RRB- which is very near Town Hall in the city .
I 'll do my best , there is an outlet that , when I fly into ENTITY_Sydney , I make a point of getting to the ENTITY_Parklea_Markets in ENTITY_Sydney 's western suburbs , it is really worth the trip out there .
Try ` Revenge Fashion ' on ENTITY_George_Street to start with , ENTITY_Tel 2 9264 4400 , there are often bargains to be had there .
` ENTITY_Leesa ' in Piccadilly Place on ENTITY_Pitt_Street has locally made clothes at pretty decent prices .
ENTITY_Westfield_Bondi Junction-the big shopping centre on Burwood has shops like ENTITY_SES , Supre and ENTITY_Bardot where you wo n't spend too many dollars .
There are a number of factory seconds shops in ENTITY_Sydney with some in ENTITY_Foveaux_Street near Central Station .
Shopping , well most people from ENTITY_Miama would want Rip Curl , ENTITY_Mambo and Billabong gear , which you can buy at surf shops at ENTITY_Bondi_Beach or ENTITY_Manly_Beach .
Also the rocks market , paddies market and Glebe market -LRB- among many others -RRB- on weekends .
Go down to the Rocks , the birthplace of ENTITY_Sydney , lots of cool little shops tucked away there , a little touristy but still good .
Get off at ENTITY_Katoomba and wander around the shops and cafes there -LRB- and also do some bush walking -RRB- .
For shopping you can go to darling harbour , ENTITY_Paddy ' market .
A MUST PITT STREET -LSB- mall -RSB- its the bets place its a massive long man road from circular quay till like the bottom on the city and it has shops all the wall down it and about 8 malls inside it .
Double Bay is the ritziest shopping area and is just a short distance the CBD .
ENTITY_Bondi_Junction is great - not the main mall , which is just the same high street stores at huge prices , but the pedestrian precinct next to the interchange and all the smaller shops around that area .
I like to shop at Oxford street in Paddington.
