Most of the NSW location will be decorated and that will instill the fellings of Xmas to our spine..
On New Years Eve they have entertainment, singers and a massive celebration at the Harbour.
On Darling Harbour The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race is starts on this day.
Take a harbor cruise toward the entrance to ENTITY_Sydney_Harbor you will see a lot of the area .
There are harbor ferries that run all over the place take one to the Aquarium you 'll be impressed with the shark tank and Maritime Museum just across the waterway .
A good idea for one day could include the morning harbour bridge climb, followed with a stroll around the rocks & along Macquarie St towards Hyde Park and St Mary's Cathedral, and past the art gallery, the botanical gardens & the opera house.
The mountain tour is the ENTITY_Blue_Mountains - which will be cold , but not too bad .
the opera house and botanical gardens , the rocks , crossing the harbor bridge , shopping , etc. just got back from ENTITY_Sydney and it is just lovely !
ENTITY_Dreamworld , ENTITY_Seaworld , ENTITY_Warner_Bros_Movie_World , Wet n Wild , Dracula 's Restaurant -LRB- i think that 's what it 's called -RRB- , the Casino , the beaches , Surfers Paradise , not to mention all the smaller attractions as well .
Take a walk around the harbour from the ENTITY_Sydney_Opera_House to the historic distric known as The Rocks , great views of the ENTITY_Harbour_Bridge etc. .
But what really inspired me the first time, was the supper cruise with John Cadman, then it was the Explorer 2000, not sure what they have now.
The best way to experience the harbour is by exploring it on a dinner cruise .
The beach is free and cheap to get to if you take public transport .
ENTITY_Sydney has a great deal of one of kind `` Things to Do '' . 
There are a number of places in the Rocks to visit .
