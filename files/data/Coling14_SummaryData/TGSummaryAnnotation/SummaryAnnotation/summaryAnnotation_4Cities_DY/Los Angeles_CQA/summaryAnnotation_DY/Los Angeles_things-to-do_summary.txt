LA is not like a traditional city where everything is down town and everyone goes home to the suburbs at night . 
There is the ENTITY_Convention_Center , ENTITY_Olvera_Street , museums , and Staples Center , but you did n't want to be in ENTITY_Downtown_LA at night .
I would say check ENTITY_Venice_Beach one of the nicer beaches in the area ... and Lots to see -LRB- people watching -RRB- but if shoppings you thing Melrose Ave would be a cool place to go .
take a walk up and down hollywood bld between ENTITY_La_Brea and western it dont cost anything and u will enterained by not only the sites but the people u see b carfull and have a good time
Or drive around with a car in ENTITY_Beverly_Hills to see the stars ' homes .
After you arrive and check in to your hotel , go to ENTITY_Santa_Monica and to the Third Street Promenade .
If you have to stay in ENTITY_LA , there 's ENTITY_Universal_Studios city walk .
The Chinese Theater in ENTITY_Hollywood_Blvd has the famous hand prints , and if you 're in town for a movie premiere , check out the celebrities walking down the red carpet .
ENTITY_LA has historical places to visit and ethnic places like ENTITY_China town and Olvera -LRB- little ENTITY_Mexico -RRB- Street .
Take a drive or cab down ENTITY_Sunset_Blvd. , starting at the beach and see some live music in ENTITY_Hollywood , somewhere like the Roxy .
If you 're into flowers check out the ENTITY_LA_Flower_Mart early in the morning .
If you want to slum it with the hipsters drink at the ENTITY_Golden_Gopher , ENTITY_Broadway_Bar and ENTITY_Redwood_Bar_&_Grill .
You then can go back to Union Station and hop on one of the ENTITY_Metro_Lines and visit the civic center , ENTITY_Hollywood and other areas .
I recommend going to the Music Center or Staples center
Go to the ENTITY_Staples_Center and see a Laker 's games
