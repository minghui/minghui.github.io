There are TONS and TONS of unique neighborhoods with shops ...
The ENTITY_Beverly_Center is the largest mall in ENTITY_LA , but it 's not really my favorite .
In ENTITY_Los_Angeles itself , you have : The ENTITY_Grove_Beverly_Center_Eagle_Rock_Plaza which are all decent .
the most popular is the beverly center of course , they recently remodeled it too , it looks nice and theres a lot of stores in there .
The Third Street Promenade in ENTITY_Santa_Monica is definitely my favorite , but I also like the Westside Pavillion and the ENTITY_Del_Amo_Fashion_Center in ENTITY_Torrance .
Melrose Avenue or the Beverly Center in ENTITY_Bev_Hills , but I would go to Melrose ...
The westside pavilion , century city , or fox hills mall .
take them shopping in ENTITY_Beverly_Hills or ENTITY_Irvine , in like ENTITY_Fashion_Island , that is an outdoors magnificent mall .
The Grove is one of those outside shopping centers , and the whole scenery is kind of nice .
A lot of tourists go 2 ENTITY_Hollywood n highland 2 shop but most locals do n't b/c its always crowded .
ENTITY_Los_Angelenos go such places as : the Beveryly Center -LRB- 8 stories of high-end designer fashion shopping -RRB- 8500 ENTITY_Beverly_Blvd.
The Block at ENTITY_Orange is the nearest mall to ENTITY_Disneyland .
If you want something incredibly different to tell your friends about , you want to go to the ENTITY_LA_fashion_district , just east of downtown LA , around Olympic Blvd.
If you want to go shopping , the closest big mall is the ENTITY_Brea mall .
if you are in ENTITY_anaheim then you will want to check out ENTITY_South_Coast_Plaza in nearby ENTITY_Costa_Mesa .
