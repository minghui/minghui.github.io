Yes , people DO use/rely on the subway in ENTITY_LA , as well as the bus system .
Lucky for you that the ENTITY_Los_Angeles - ENTITY_Bay_Area corridor is the most heavily traveled routes in the ENTITY_United_States .
Taking the metro is the quickest and best way around
Our ENTITY_Metro bus and rail system costs $ 3.00 for an all day pass .
Our mass transit system here is not very good and you will literally spend hours and have to change buses/trains many times to do what you want .
You really need a car in ENTITY_LA , the public transportation is n't as good as in ENTITY_NYC , ENTITY_Boston , ENTITY_Paris , etc. .
Know this about ENTITY_LA , the reason we have horrible traffic is because the area is so vast , a car is often the only option .
okay los Angeles is spread out a lot so so you could find your self riding transit up to a hour to your destination maybe more maybe less
There are n't cabs driving around everywhere like ENTITY_NY .
You can maneuver around the city via our alleged public transportation system .
ENTITY_Southwest usually has some pretty cheap flights between ENTITY_LA and SF , so you might check there , or look up commuter flights between the two cities .
if you get a hotel near LAX you will get a lot of traffic , because there are alwas so many cars trying to get in and out of the airport .Yes downtown is not a major touristy area at all and the traffic in and around downtown on weekdays are killer .
The ENTITY_Red_Line is fast , cheap , and reliable and well lit and there are always sheriff 's and metro security patrolling the stations and cars .
the subway is fine and rememebr there are sheriff deputies partoling the stations as well and if you take the subway you will save on parking in downtown LA -LRB- which can run you up $ 20.00 sometimes just dont miss the last train back to hollywood !
Renting a car certainly will make a huge difference for you and your friend for making your trip way worthwhile .
