ENTITY_Downtown_L.A. has the City Hall , ENTITY_Disney_Concert_Hall , the 90 block Fashion District , the ENTITY_Flower_Market , ENTITY_Chinatown , ENTITY_Olvera_St._Union_Station . ENTITY_Santa_Monica and ENTITY_Venice are lively , fun and great places to visit .
Union Station itself is nice .
Right across the street is Olvera Street , and you have ENTITY_Phillippe 's a couple blocks away , and ENTITY_Chinatown a couple blocks away .
If you 're into flowers check out the ENTITY_LA_Flower_Mart early in the morning .
If you 're into nightlife have dinner at Blue Velvet for a great view of the city then afterward go to the Roof Bar at the ENTITY_Standard_Hotel , Seven Grand and to the ENTITY_Edison for drinks .
The Music Center for concerts and theatrical productions of all kinds .
check little ENTITY_tokyo , ENTITY_china town , disney music hall , angel flights ...
This is a must see ENTITY_Peterson_Automotive_Museum_6060_Wilshire_Blvd , ENTITY_Los_Angeles , CA
ENTITY_Catalina_Island is one of my favorite ENTITY_Southern_California getaways .
I always take my out of town visitors to the ENTITY_El_Pueblo_de_Los_Angeles Historical Park which includes Olvera Street , the oldest street in ENTITY_Los_Angeles .
Then you have ENTITY_Chinatown which we really enjoy .
ENTITY_Olivera_Street in downtown ENTITY_Los_Angeles is a neat part of town .
Check out the Getty Center its free -LRB- parking ten bucks -RRB- or maybe the ENTITY_Los_Angeles Farmers Market .
ENTITY_Chinatown is pretty small , and not really dangerous at all during the day .
The ENTITY_Walt_Disney_Concert_Hall is across the street and I would say it 's a great photo op .
