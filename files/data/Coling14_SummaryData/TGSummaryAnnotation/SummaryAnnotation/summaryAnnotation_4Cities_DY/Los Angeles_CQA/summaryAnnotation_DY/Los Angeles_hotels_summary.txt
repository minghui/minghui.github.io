I think your best choices would be one of these : Hotel Menage Anaheim Boutique Hotel 1221 S Harbor Blvd ENTITY_Anaheim , CA , 92805 Anabella Hotel 1030 W Katella Ave ENTITY_Anaheim , CA , 92802 ENTITY_Anaheim_Portofino_Inn and Suites 1831 S Harbor Blvd ENTITY_Anaheim , CA , 92802 Of these , my favorite would be ENTITY_Anaheim_Portofino_Inn and Suites ... which also has free parking , and a cheap shuttle that takes you to ENTITY_Disneyland so you wo n't have to deal with driving and parking at the park : -RRB-
ENTITY_Santa_Monica is def . the nicest of the places you listed BUT it 's not close to a train / metro station and it 's $ $ $ $ .
They have almost every brand name of hotel imaginable around there ie Best Western , ENTITY_Marriott , ENTITY_Travelodge , ENTITY_Raddison , etc. .
he ENTITY_Anaehim_Desert_Inn and Suites right across from the park have inexpensive suites , some have jacuzzi tubs , all are very spacious and they have pool , not sure about the slide
The best place to stay -LRB- if you are n't actually on the property -RRB- is right along ENTITY_Harbor_Blvd.
ENTITY_Sheraton - large sleeper room with fridge - hotel was just remodeled last year - free shuttle bus every 1/2 hour to the Park - we have stayed 3 times already in the past 2 years .
If money is not a factor : The Grand Californian Hotel is BEAUTIFUL ! It runs about 250 + a night
I recommend the Jolly ENTITY_Roger_Inn , which is a ENTITY_Disneyland_Resort good neighbor hotel .
However if you are driving , and do n't mind trading the convenience of being right next to the park to save some money , you should consider lodging in neighboring cities such as : ENTITY_Buena_Park , ENTITY_Fullerton , and ENTITY_Garden_Grove .
The ENTITY_Disneyland_Resort is the best for families with kids .
The two I always recommend are the Candy Cane Inn and the ENTITY_Howard_Johnson , right there on Harbor Blvd 
In ENTITY_Hollywood , I recommend the Orchid Suites , ENTITY_Hollywood_Celebrity_Hotel , or Holiday Inn Walk of Fame , all near ENTITY_Hollywood and ENTITY_Highland .
The ENTITY_Best_Western_Sunset_Plaza is a great deal and it is walking distance to all of the bars clubs and resturaunts in ENTITY_Weho .
I recommend the Farmer 's Daughter Hotel near Third and ENTITY_Fairfax , a pretty safe area right in the middle of the city .
The Grand Californian is the best , followed by the ENTITY_Disneyland_Hotel and the Pacific Pier Hotel .
