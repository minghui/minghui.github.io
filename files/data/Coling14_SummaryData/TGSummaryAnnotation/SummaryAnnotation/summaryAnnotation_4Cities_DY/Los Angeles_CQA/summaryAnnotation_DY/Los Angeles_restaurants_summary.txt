Good food is everywhere , from In N out to Pink 's and basically every mexican shop has good food haha .
Here are my faves for nice local restaurants : Restaurant ENTITY_Christine -LRB- has vegetarian options -RRB- , ENTITY_Petros in ENTITY_Manhattan_Beach -LRB- also with vegetarian options -RRB- , ENTITY_Kincaid 's in ENTITY_Redondo .
if you really want some great food , there 's this great mexican place called ENTITY_El_Taurino on hoover and olympic .
ENTITY_Santa_Barbara gets my vote for romantic destinations in the area .
if you are staying right inside ENTITY_Disney then just eat at the restaurant near your hotel it 's self serve so there is n't any waiting .
I go every Sunday to meet friends for breakfast , and here 's my suggestion that 's not too expensive At downtown ENTITY_Disney , there 's Catals .
Also , Downtown Disney -LRB- between the Disneyland Hotel and the Theme Park entrances -RRB- has a few restaurants open .
also from what i remember there is a resteraunt at the disneyland hotel that has a non-buffet style breakfast .
here 's a ENTITY_Coco 's at W Katella Av and S West St , due south of the Paradise Pier Hotel .
Try ENTITY_Arrowhead , ENTITY_Santa_Barbara or any of the beach cities .
ENTITY_Santa_barbara_Oxnard_Newport beach ENTITY_San_Diego_Palm_Springs_Big_Bear_torrance restaurant lucilles bbq is the best ... but that wont help u since your a vegetarian , but they make the best biscuts with home made apple butter , they are awesome the kings hawaiian bread factory is there and they have a nice restaurant restaurant christine is pretty good these arent strictly veggie , but they have veggie options
Go to Foo Chow Restaurant , again the food is generic , meaning you find the same everywhere , but they have better prices and service !
Definitely go to Grand Central Market in downtown - they have so many different kinds of food ... but the craving that always gets me to go is for the pupusas -LRB- ENTITY_Salvadorian food -RRB- ...
BBQ King on ENTITY_Caesar Chavez/Sunset and ENTITY_Figueroa_Swingers , either ENTITY_Beverly or SM location Fred 62 on ENTITY_Vermont_Yang_Chow in ENTITY_Chinatown
Actually , the ENTITY_Plaza_Inn provides a pretty good view of the parade if you are outside at one of the tables closer to the Hub .
