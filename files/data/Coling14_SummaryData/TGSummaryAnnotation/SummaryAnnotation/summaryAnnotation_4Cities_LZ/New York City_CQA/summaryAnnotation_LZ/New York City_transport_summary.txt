ENTITY_LaGuardia is a domestic airport , so you 'll need to be back there before Seven . 
If you are coming from ENTITY_Jersey , you can take a ferry from ENTITY_Port_Imperial , ENTITY_Weehawken .
Once you arrive in midtown , you can catch a free shuttle bus -LRB- available in front of terminal -RRB- .
You may be better off parking in the suburbs , and taking the commuter rail in .
The shuttle buses can take you to Times Square , Theatre District , ENTITY_Chelsea_Piers , the Village ... just about anywhere in ENTITY_NYC . 
 If you go to ENTITY_Manhattan , you 'll find a parking garage everywhere and the train stations are always near , they 'll give you a subway map , if anything you can always call 411 and they can help you . 
Unless you plan to drive around ENTITY_New_Jersey , do n't rent a car - parking is extremely expensive and driving around midtown is a nightmare .
No matter where you stay , if you can get to ENTITY_Manhattan , you can get to Yankee Stadium easily by subway . 
Times Square to/from Central Park is walkable . 
There is a shuttle that goes between the 2 airports and it will only cost you $ 13.
The side streets and ENTITY_Riverside_Avenue are free .
nyc is horrible for parking , and the car can be vandelized . 
he best way to get around ENTITY_Manhattan is to walk if it 's less than a mile - I use buses most of the time and only use the subway if the weather 's too bad to wait outside for the bus or I 'm going a long distance -LRB- the subway 's faster than the bus , but the time difference is n't that much for a short distance -RRB- . 
You ca n't even drive into ENTITY_Manhattan on New Year 's Eve .
My friend , taxis in ENTITY_New_York_City charge by the meter rate , so a ride from Times Square to Canal Street will be roughly about $ 10 to $ 15 .
