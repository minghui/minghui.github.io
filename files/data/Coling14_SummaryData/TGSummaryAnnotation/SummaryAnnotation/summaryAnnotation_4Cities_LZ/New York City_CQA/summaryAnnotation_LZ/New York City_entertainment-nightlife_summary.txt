 Go to Times Square , Shop , catch a good play on Broadway , go clubbing , research some great restaurants and eat wonderful food !
 if you like Jazz , there are countless Jazz clubs all around town , but a large concentration of them in ENTITY_Greenwich_Village ;
if you like more Classical Music or Opera , check out what 's going on at ENTITY_Lincoln_Center or Carnegie Hall ; 
there are numerous Art Movie Houses around town showing foreign and independent films not showing anywhere else.
ENTITY_MoMA has film nights , and Film Forum is just one art movie house .
Yes , there are comedy clubs , and of course a ENTITY_Mets or ENTITY_Yankee 's game , but even more fun would be to take the ENTITY_Brooklyn_Bound_Q train to the last stop ENTITY_Stillwell_Avenue in ENTITY_Coney_Island , get nathan 's ENTITY_Franks and Fries and go see a ENTITY_Brooklyn_Cyclones baseball game .
Definitely a Broadway show if you could do it . 
If not , there 's shopping in times square , madison ave , and ENTITY_china town -LRB- which is great !
You may also want to check out the ENTITY_MTV studio depending on how old you are .
The area to avoid at night in Central Park is ... THE ENTIRE PARK ! 
Generally speaking on the horses you are safe but walking around ... you take a BIG risk .
 Although there were some events happened in the past , I find Central Park relatively safe at night , however you should always be careful , and definitely do n't walk with your i-pod at night so you wo n't hear if someone approaches you . 
There is shakespear in the park at night in the summers , as well as various concerts and all are well lit , very crowded , and very safe . 
ENTITY_New_York_City is world famous for it 's Broadway shows , towering skyscrapers , dining , nightlife and rich history .
here are street fairs throughout the summer , free concerts , free museums and the beauty of just walking the streets of this great city .
