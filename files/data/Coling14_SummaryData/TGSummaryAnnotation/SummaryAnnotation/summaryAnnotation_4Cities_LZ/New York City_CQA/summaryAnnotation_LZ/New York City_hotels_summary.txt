Close to Times SQ. , Broadway and Central Park is the ENTITY_Wellington , it 's decent enough and competitively priced for the area . 
Once you decide on where you are going to stay , call the concierge desk of the hotel and have him schedule a private van or towncar service for you from ENTITY_JFK .
Check out turbotrip.com , ENTITY_hotels.com , and hotwire.com all which offer decent hotels at reasonable rates . 
Two that I can recommend are : Big Apple Hostel Jazz on the Town -LRB- East Village location only -RRB- Here is a link to a list of hostels : http://www.hostels.com/en/us.ny.ny.html.
The hotels ARE expensive in NYC , but if you look hard you can find something around $ 100 with a shared bathroom .
New Yorkers do n't have a concept of half board so you wo n't find any half board accomodation .
 the bathroom will have 2 doors , one leading to one room and one leading to the other and usually it 's the only bathroom available for both rooms to use which is why you have to share .
The ENTITY_Pennsylvania is one of the worst hotels in ENTITY_New_York - it 's dirty , smells bad and has bed bugs .
Most places in ENTITY_New_York are pretty safe .
Try and find a hotel in downtown brooklyn or queens thats about some of the cheapest places.
If you 're on a budget , I 'd stay at the New Yorker hotel near ENTITY_Penn_Station . 
 For a middle-priced hotel , the ENTITY_Renaissance_Times_Square ca n't be beat .
 If money is no object , I 'd normally recommend the ENTITY_Pierre ; 
Book a room at the ENTITY_Newark_Penn_Station_Hilton and request the government rate .
There are hardly any reasonably priced decent hotels in NYC .
