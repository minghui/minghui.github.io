 The best ENTITY_Deli ever is ENTITY_Katz 's Deli which is on the lower east side .
Lucky Chengs Asian and ENTITY_Polynesian food but a drag queen cabaret show that is amazing , it is located : 24 First Avenue between 1st and 2nd Street OMG we 've had bachelorette parties there , and just dinner in general , very different and very NYC an experience you will never forget and the food is great and not overly priced .
Best eating in Wo Hop on ENTITY_Mott_Street .
 I 'd head on down to the World Trade Center area and go eat at ENTITY_Tony_Bourdain 's ENTITY_Les_Halle_Restaurant .
Wo Hop , 15 ENTITY_Mott_Street in ENTITY_Chinatown followed by La Bella Ferarra Canolis on Mulberry Street in ENTITY_Little_Italy -LRB- they are only a few blocks apart -RRB- . 
Also , if you walk by a restaurant and see that it is zagat rated , you 'll know it is good .
 well , NY pizza is THE best pizza in ENTITY_america .
 ENTITY_New_York style Pizza , hot dogs , gyros , falafels , just look up the carts around rockfeller , there 's one near the ENTITY_Hilton that has a long line and is open only after 7 p.m.
 Dirty water hot dogs from a street vendor , a NYC taste treat .
 Joes Pizza on bleeker street ENTITY_Carmines in Times Square battery park city -LRB- shake shake and a beautiful park -RRB- not far from world trade center site.
NY pizza is awesome , I actually found a spot in ENTITY_Tampa that has official NY pizza .
When I go to NY I also bring back White Castle hamburgers , I just love them .
Or you could just come here and experience not only our pizza , but also the chinese food , deli , bagels and other great food that 's either unique to ENTITY_New_York or only available in that quality in a handful of places in the world .
 May I suggest ENTITY_Dallas BBQ 's a small chain of restaurants specialize in fine barbecue cuisine . 
sushi samba has the best ambiance for a yougn hip crowd , live entertainment as its a fusion of sushi and spanish cusine .
