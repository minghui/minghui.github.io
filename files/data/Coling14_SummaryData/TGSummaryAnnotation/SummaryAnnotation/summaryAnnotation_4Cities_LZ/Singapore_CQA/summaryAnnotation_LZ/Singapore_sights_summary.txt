 the public transport system is very big and clean and efficient , especially compared to the tube in ENTITY_London . 
Good shopping and very clean streets in general . 
What I suggest is bring them to water-park !
 Hard to do too much in one day but be sure to get to ENTITY_East_Coast_Park and eat some famous SIngapore Chilli Crab . 
Also , a Sling at Raffles would be worth the historical trip ! 
Try ENTITY_Sungei_Buloh_Wetland_Reserve on an early sunday morning , away from the city area and u can immerse totally into nature , only the sound of the birds and insects on the trees .
A four square Church or a Assembely of God church .
You got the Orchids Park , the Wax Museum , the ENTITY_China_Town , ENTITY_The_Arab_Town , the ENTITY_Musical_Fountains , and plenty more .
Sentosa -LRB- beautiful scenes , music fountains , world famous merlion.
the night safari zoo is located next to the day zoo it is a great idea to allow the animals to make more overtime money .

 ENTITY_Chinatown , ENTITY_Little_India , ENTITY_Arab_Street , ENTITY_Haji_Lane - just to take in the sights and sounds of this place .
The ENTITY_Singapore Flyer - new attraction , a giant ferris wheel with panoramic views of singapore ENTITY_The_Heritage_Centre at ENTITY_Chinatown - a glimpse of how the first chinese imigrants used to live .
