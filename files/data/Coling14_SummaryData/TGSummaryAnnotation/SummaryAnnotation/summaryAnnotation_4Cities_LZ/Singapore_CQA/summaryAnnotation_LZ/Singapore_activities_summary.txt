What I suggest is bring them to water-park ! 
ENTITY_Jurong_Swimming_Complex or Wild-wild Wet ! 
The second choice would be Bugis Street . 
You got the Orchids Park , the Wax Museum , the ENTITY_China_Town , ENTITY_The_Arab_Town , the ENTITY_Musical_Fountains , and plenty more . 
shopping areas would be : ENTITY_Orchard , Vivocity , ENTITY_Raffles place , CityHall are the main hot spots for shopping .
 ENTITY_Singapore best time is when every foreigner are not in ENTITY_Singapore ?
However , if you stay on during the Chinese New Year , you would be bored like what the other person mentioned as most shops would be closed .
If you like the nights , you can visit ENTITY_Jalan_Sultan , where there are lots of clubs .
 the night safari zoo is located next to the day zoo it is a great idea to allow the animals to make more overtime money .
 I usually bring my kids to the beach , they love it there , I can just dump their sand castle tools and I 'm free to just enjoy the afternoon talking to my hubby .
 I live in ENTITY_Singapore as far as I know the best place you can enjoy here is in ENTITY_Sentosa . 
The Bird Park is well thought of but for me the ` ENTITY_House_of_Darkness ' is the only MUST SEE !
 ENTITY_Changi_Gaol_Museum is interesting and reverent .
You can hire bicycles to ride around the island and see what ENTITY_Singapore used to look like .
RRB- On the way back stop at ENTITY_Sempang_Bedok at the ` Ancient Chinese Cusine ' Restaurant for the best and most unique Chinese food you will find .
