Hello , from personal experience the booking.com works great for me . 
A hotel is a lodging place with extras like restaurants , pools , conference rooms and sometimes gyms . 
A hostel is a place where you can rent a room or even just a bed within a large group room and there 's usually shared restrooms and a shared kitchen . 
there r quite a few hotels in ENTITY_Orchard area where u can try . 
 ENTITY_Allson hotel - next to Victoria Hotel 
 Hotel on the ENTITY_Queens - behind ENTITY_Allson Hotel.
Strand Hotel - on Bencoolen if I 'm not wrong . 
 York Hotel - at ENTITY_Orchard_Road . 
 ENTITY_Elizabeth_Hotel - Probably slightly a bit more than ENTITY_Victoria and in ENTITY_Orchard . 
ENTITY_Furama_Hotel_City_Centre - at ENTITY_Chinatown .
