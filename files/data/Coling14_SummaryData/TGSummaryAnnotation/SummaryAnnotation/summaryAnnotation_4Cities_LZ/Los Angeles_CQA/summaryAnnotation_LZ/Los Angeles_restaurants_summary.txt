New Orleans Clam Chowder !
tay away from the Buzz Lighyear Stage area food , and the resteraunt in Fantasyland .
go to the Pavillion for Breakfast with the ENTITY_Pooh characters . 
if you are staying right inside ENTITY_Disney then just eat at the restaurant near your hotel it 's self serve so there is n't any waiting .
 Fatburgers is very good not better than In N Out though , but if In N Out had chili it would put Fatburgers out of business .
 I can not think of any restaurants long Main Street that would provide you with a good view of the parade . 
Definitely go to Grand Central Market in downtown - they have so many different kinds of food .
Scheesch Dog , you deserve the good stuff .
BBQ King on ENTITY_Caesar Chavez/Sunset and ENTITY_Figueroa_Swingers , either ENTITY_Beverly or SM location Fred 62 on ENTITY_Vermont_Yang_Chow in ENTITY_Chinatown.
A good 4-star restaurant will cost you $ 30 - $ 50 per person . 
The Roosevelt and ENTITY_Grafton are good places .
A very good food of famous fashionable restaurant shall ask you more than $ 300 and tax and tips . 
Food here is expensive .
When we went , we snuck in some of our own food , due to the incredibly high $ they wanted . 
There are sit-down restaurants as well as walk-up , fast food places and the crowds are n't as bad as they are inside ENTITY_Disneyland .
