The westside pavilion , century city , or fox hills mall . 
 If you 're not looking for designer stuff , I 'd say Melrose . 
For boutiques , I 'd say ENTITY_Robertson between ENTITY_Beverly and 3rd Str . 
take them shopping in ENTITY_Beverly_Hills or ENTITY_Irvine , in like ENTITY_Fashion_Island , that is an outdoors magnificent mall .
ENTITY_Glendale_Galleria seems to be a popular hang out spot for a lot of teens , and a lot of the stores they have are n't as expensive as the others . 
For a cross-cultural shopping experience , try ENTITY_Chinatown in downtown LA -LRB- www.chinatownla.com -RRB- and Olvera Street -LRB- www.olvera-street.com -RRB- - they 're both within walking distance of each other and Union Station .
 If you are talking about LA the city , ENTITY_Sladster did a great job . 
 If you want outlet style stores , the Citadel off the 5 freeway has a lot of stores . 
The Garment District in downtown LA has clothes , and once a month the designers discard their samples . 
The 3rd Street Promenade in SM is n't a mall , but it 's hands down my fav place to shop here .
There is some mall in the ENTITY_Valley - I think it 's in ENTITY_Woodland_Hills - that is pretty sweet , but I do n't usually trek there . 
Having been to mostly all of them we personally liked the ENTITY_Glendale mall a lot and then the Beverly Center .
The Block at ENTITY_Orange is the nearest mall to ENTITY_Disneyland . 
There 's a couple of not great malls in ENTITY_Anaheim .
People from ENTITY_Los_Angeles like to shop anywhere .
