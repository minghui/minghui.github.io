 LA is so large that I recommend staying near the places you 'll be visiting . 
If you want a really fun time , try staying in ENTITY_Santa_Monica near the pier . 
 ENTITY_Best_Western_&_Holiday_Inn are very kid friendly ;
 sure not the east side dont go there that the worst place to go they trust me !
 Not sure if any of them have a slide but most of them do have pools .
 One of the best kept secrets is Garden Grove ! 
 I would definitely suggest reserving a room .
There are some very bad parts of ENTITY_LA surrounding ENTITY_Disneyland and LAX . 
 November is a busy month because of Thanksgiving , many families get together for the holidays or travel .
here are a whole bunch of hotels in the disneyland area , and walking distance is n't really a big issue because they have a very convienient tram service that services all the big hotels .
 I recommend the HoJo ENTITY_Anaheim and the Candy Cane Inn .
the ENTITY_Disneyland hotels are the best -- they are right on property , with easy access to the theme parks . 
 The ENTITY_Disneyland_Resorts , although beautiful and within walking distance , are outrageously priced . 
 If you want good ones , I recommend the Best Western Sunset Plaza in ENTITY_West_Hollywood , the Renaissance in ENTITY_Hollywood , or the ENTITY_Hilton in ENTITY_Universal_City . 
You do understand that ENTITY_West_Hollywood has a reputation of being a `` gay '' area .
