I live in Sydney and would thoroughly recommend Darling harbour/Sydney city as a good place to eat out at.
Along the waterfront, there are an array of excellent restaurants ranging from char grill to seafood.
there are some nice restaurants along the circular quay/opera house area as well as the Opera Bar which I quite highly recommend.
In ENTITY_Port_Douglas , there is a place on Macrossan Street -LRB- ie the main street -RRB- that does great wood fired pizza .
You have to go to Pancakes In The Rocks !
King St ENTITY_Newtown and ENTITY_Glebe are great places to find a huge range of inexpensive restaurants that serve good food .
 My favourite places are the ENTITY_Lowenbrau -LRB- in Argyle -RRB- and the ENTITY_Prague -LRB- in King 's Cross -RRB- , ENTITY_Frisco 's -LRB- in ENTITY_Woolamaloo -RRB- , and ENTITY_Fitzroy 's -LRB- King 's Cross -RRB- .
there are many restaurants to choose in Star City Casino (including an all you can eat buffet) and there are also several good places in Chinatown.
Kay you 'd pay that much eating at the ENTITY_Hilton , there are heaps of international cafe 's and clubs you can get a decent meal from $ 5 to $ 10 bucks plus you do n't have to tip . 
 city extra - circular quay its nice but expensive.
 Out of ENTITY_Africa in Manly Superbowl or BBQ King in ENTITY_Chinatown -LRB- Service and decor is crap but the food is great -RRB- The Sushi Bar at the ENTITY_Sydney_Fish_Markets_Harrys_Cafe_de_Wheels.
If you want something different in the suburbs then go to the 18 footer in ENTITY_Double_Bay , right on the water . 
Another option is to go to ENTITY_Watson 's Bay for the famous fish and chips . 
ENTITY_Tetsuya 's in ENTITY_Sydney has been voted one of the top 5 restaurents in the world .
 Go to the two major restaurant areas close to the city - ENTITY_Darlinghurst , along ENTITY_Oxford_Street , and ENTITY_Newtown , along King Street .
