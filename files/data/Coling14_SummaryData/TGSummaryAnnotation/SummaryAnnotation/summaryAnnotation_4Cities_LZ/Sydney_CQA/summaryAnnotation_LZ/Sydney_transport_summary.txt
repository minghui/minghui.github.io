there is good bus service or train the best is to take a orgonised tour of the city .
If you are staying in ENTITY_Sydney 's central area you can walk everywhere , and the walking is pleasant and interesting . 
You can buy a day ticket which gives you unlimited access to all trains , government buses and most ferries .
It took me a little over 10hr to drive from ENTITY_Melbourne to ENTITY_Sydney -LRB- during night and within speed limit -RRB- , but I only stopped for gas and bathroom , so if you spend time in motel , you will not make it .
The flight is exactly 13.5 hours direct from Syd to LA, wheels up syd to touch down LAX, done it many times and have had my stop- watch on.
Here is , in answer to your question , a comparison of all the transport operators in ENTITY_Sydney : Westbus/Hillsbus -LRB- Hills/Western Suburbs , ENTITY_South-West -RRB- -7 / 10 -LRB- dont use it much though -RRB- ENTITY_Sydney Buses -LRB- CBD , Northern Beaches , ENTITY_Eastern subs , inner west -RRB- -8 / 10 CityRail -LRB- trains -RRB- -6 / 10 Light Rail-10 / 10 Monorail-8 / 10 Ferries-8 / 10 Taxis - 8/10 -LRB- dont use them much though -RRB- Rickshaws-No idea since I have never used them Water Taxis-Never used them so dont know.
Rating 3 , it 's dirty , not on time , confusing , too expensive and congested .
he only place i can think of where a tourist might consider renting a car is a day to go to the blue mountains -LRB- which i personally would still get the train to -RRB- as for taxis , there ok if you are completely lost or its late at night or something , but during the day do n't bother . 
Do n't get a car , many hotels do n't even have parking , those that do charge $ 20 + per night . 
You can catch an intercity train with ENTITY_Cityrail from just about anywhere in ENTITY_Sydney to ENTITY_Katoomba .
Take a TRAIN from the airport into the city . 
Perhaps take a subway into the city -LRB- there 's a station at the airport , it takes 20 minutes to get to the city -RRB- , get out at Circular Quay station and walk up to the ENTITY_Opera_House -LRB- about a 5 minute walk from the station -RRB- .
 Caught a train to the city , bought a ticket on a sightseeing bus and spend the available time seeing all I could , before having to get back to the airport .
As an alternative you can catch the XPT Train from Brisbane to Central (Sydney), it's an easy bus to Brisbane from the Gold Coast.
There is not a great deal within walking distance but you could try ENTITY_Barton_Park .
