`` Ayers Rock '' will not describe , you visit , you will not be disappointed , vast country , spread out a bit but if you have the time visit , prior to going , the web page & drool over the sights.
Gold coast is beautiful scenery but ENTITY_Sydney is a spectacular city .
Simply walk around the harbour side to the opera house its lovely with many cafes and you can take either a tourist cruise around the harbour with a running commentary or you can get the local commuter ferries which of course a lot cheaper.
Take a harbor cruise to the Sydney Toranga Zoo you'll see all the country's animals. 
Tour the Opera house if there is a concert try see it. 
Make sure, if you are up to it to do the bridge climb, this is a real treat. 
There is a museum on one on the pillars close to the rocks that explain the bridge and harbor. 
There is a monorail in town you have to ride it once. 
Best place in my opinion is ENTITY_Mrs_Macquaries_Point -LRB- enter on the day via ENTITY_Art_Gallery_Road - other entrances will be blocked off -RRB- . 
Walk around Hyde Park Gardens and visit Oxford street(Gay Area) Sydney Museum and then walk over to Wooloollomoo where Russell Crowe lives - Cafes and restaurants along the waterfront Take the 324 bus from Circular Quay to Double Bay, a lovely little place known as Double Bay, Double Pay as there are expensive shops there.
