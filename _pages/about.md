About Me
========
I am a third-year PhD student in the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) , College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst under the supervision of Prof. W. Bruce Croft. I am also working closely with Prof. Jiafeng Guo.

I was a Research Assistant at Text Mining Group in School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, under the supervision of Prof. Jing Jiang on text mining and machine learning. I was working closely with Prof. Feida Zhu. I got my Master degree in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts Amherst and another Master Degree from Peking University. For industrial experiences, I worked as a research intern in Microsoft Research Redmond, Microsoft Bing and a software engineer intern in Search R&D Department of Baidu Inc. My research areas include information retrieval, natural language processing,  text mining and machine learning. I have published papers in conferences such as SIGIR, CIKM, ICDM, NAACL, COLING and ECIR, including a co-authored paper that was a runner-up for the best paper award in SocInfoâ€™13. I'm now focusing on research on deep learning, question answering, statistical language models, probabilistic graphical models, ranking and relevance, learning to rank and online user modeling/profiling.
